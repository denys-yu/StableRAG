Three more shelves to fill with space-slain warriors—and he would be among the living again.\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n He heard the star-port grind open, and the movement of the metal claws groping into space, and then the star-port closed.\n \n There was another dead man aboard the Constellation .\n \n Sam Burnett shook his long head, trying to think clearly. Pallid and quiet, three bodies lay on the cold transparent tables around him; machines stirred, revolved, hummed. He didn't see them. He didn't see anything but a red haze over his mind. It blotted out the far wall of the laboratory where the shelves went up and down, numbered in scarlet, keeping the bodies of soldiers from all further harm.\n \n Burnett didn't move. He stood there in his rumpled white surgical gown, staring at his fingers gloved in bone-white rubber; feeling all tight and wild inside himself. It went on for days. Moving the ship. Opening the star-port. Extending the retriever claw. Plucking some poor warrior's body out of the void.\n \n He didn't like it any more. Ten years is too long to go back and forth from Earth to nowhere. You came out empty and you went back full-cargoed with a lot of warriors who didn't laugh or talk or smoke, who just lay on their shelves, all one hundred of them, waiting for a decent burial.\n \n \"Number ninety-eight.\" Coming matter of fact and slow, Rice's voice from the ceiling radio hit Burnett.\n \n \"Number ninety-eight,\" Burnett repeated. \"Working on ninety-five, ninety-six and ninety-seven now. Blood-pumps, preservative, slight surgery.\" Off a million miles away his voice was talking. It sounded deep. It didn't belong to him anymore.\n \n Rice said:\n \n \"Boyohbody! Two more pick-ups and back to New York. Me for a ten-day drunk!\"\n \n Burnett peeled the gloves off his huge, red, soft hands, slapped them into a floor incinerator mouth. Back to Earth. Then spin around and shoot right out again in the trail of the war-rockets that blasted one another in galactic fury, to sidle up behind gutted wrecks of ships, salvaging any bodies still intact after the conflict.\n \n Two men. Rice and himself. Sharing a cozy morgue ship with a hundred other men who had forgotten, quite suddenly, however, to talk again.\n \n Ten years of it. Every hour of those ten years eating like maggots inside, working out to the surface of Burnett's face, working under the husk of his starved eyes and starved limbs. Starved for life. Starved for action.\n \n This would be his last trip, or he'd know the reason why!\n \n \"Sam!\"\n \n Burnett jerked. Rice's voice clipped through the drainage-preservative lab, bounded against glassite retorts, echoed from the refrigerator shelves. Burnett stared at the tabled bodies as if they would leap to life, even while preservative was being pumped into their veins.\n \n \"Sam! On the double! Up the rungs!\"\n \n Burnett closed his eyes and said a couple of words, firmly. Nothing was worth running for any more. Another body. There had been one hundred thousand bodies preceding it. Nothing unusual about a body with blood cooling in it.\n \n \n\n \n Shaking his head, he walked unsteadily toward the rungs that gleamed up into the air-lock, control-room sector of the rocket. He climbed without making any noise on the rungs.\n \n He kept thinking the one thing he couldn't forget.\n  You never catch up with the war.\n \n \n All the color is ahead of you. The drive of orange rocket traces across stars, the whamming of steel-nosed bombs into elusive targets, the titanic explosions and breathless pursuits, the flags and the excited glory are always a million miles ahead.\n \n He bit his teeth together.\n  You never catch up with the war.\n \n \n You come along when space has settled back, when the vacuum has stopped trembling from unleashed forces between worlds. You come along in the dark quiet of death to find the wreckage plunging with all the fury of its original acceleration in no particular direction. You can only see it; you don't hear anything in space but your own heart kicking your ribs.\n \n You see bodies, each in its own terrific orbit, given impetus by grinding collisions, tossed from mother ships and dancing head over feet forever and forever with no goal. Bits of flesh in ruptured space suits, mouths open for air that had never been there in a hundred billion centuries. And they kept dancing without music until you extended the retriever-claw and culled them into the air-lock.\n \n That was all the war-glory he got. Nothing but the stunned, shivering silence, the memory of rockets long gone, and the shelves filling up all too quickly with men who had once loved laughing.\n \n You wondered who all the men were; and who the next ones would be. After ten years you made yourself blind to them. You went around doing your job with mechanical hands.\n \n But even a machine breaks down....\n \n \n\n \n \"Sam!\" Rice turned swiftly as Burnett dragged himself up the ladder. Red and warm, Rice's face hovered over the body of a sprawled enemy official. \"Take a look at this!\"\n \n Burnett caught his breath. His eyes narrowed. There was something wrong with the body; his experienced glance knew that. He didn't know what it was.\n \n Maybe it was because the body looked a little too dead.\n \n Burnett didn't say anything, but he climbed the rest of the way, stood quietly in the grey-metal air-lock. The enemy official was as delicately made as a fine white spider. Eyelids, closed, were faintly blue. The hair was thin silken strands of pale gold, waved and pressed close to a veined skull. Where the thin-lipped mouth fell open a cluster of needle-tipped teeth glittered. The fragile body was enclosed completely in milk-pale syntha-silk, a holstered gun at the middle.\n \n Burnett rubbed his jaw. \"Well?\"\n \n Rice exploded. His eyes were hot in his young, sharp-cut face, hot and black. \"Good Lord, Sam, do you know who this is?\"\n \n Burnett scowled uneasily and said no.\n \n \"It's Lethla!\" Rice retorted.\n \n Burnett said, \"Lethla?\" And then: \"Oh, yes! Kriere's majordomo. That right?\"\n \n \"Don't say it calm, Sam. Say it big. Say it big! If Lethla is here in space, then Kriere's not far away from him!\"\n \n Burnett shrugged. More bodies, more people, more war. What the hell. What the hell. He was tired. Talk about bodies and rulers to someone else.\n \n Rice grabbed him by the shoulders. \"Snap out of it, Sam. Think! Kriere—The All-Mighty—in our territory. His right hand man dead. That means Kriere was in an accident, too!\"\n \n Sam opened his thin lips and the words fell out all by themselves.\n\"Look, Rice, you're new at this game. I've been at it ever since the Venus-Earth mess started. It's been see-sawing back and forth since the day you played hookey in the tenth grade, and I've been in the thick of it. When there's nothing left but seared memories, I'll be prowling through the void picking up warriors and taking them back to the good green Earth. Grisly, yes, but it's routine.\n \n \"As for Kriere—if he's anywhere around, he's smart. Every precaution is taken to protect that one.\"\n \n \"But Lethla! His body must mean something!\"\n \n \"And if it does? Have we got guns aboard this morgue-ship? Are we a battle-cuiser to go against him?\"\n \n \"We'll radio for help?\"\n \n \"Yeah? If there's a warship within our radio range, seven hundred thousand miles, we'll get it. Unfortunately, the tide of battle has swept out past Earth in a new war concerning Io. That's out, Rice.\"\n \n Rice stood about three inches below Sam Burnett's six-foot-one. Jaw hard and determined, he stared at Sam, a funny light in his eyes. His fingers twitched all by themselves at his sides. His mouth twisted,\n\"You're one hell of a patriot, Sam Burnett!\"\n \n Burnett reached out with one long finger, tapped it quietly on Rice's barrel-chest. \"Haul a cargo of corpses for three thousand nights and days and see how patriotic you feel. All those fine muscled lads bloated and crushed by space pressures and heat-blasts. Fine lads who start out smiling and get the smile burned off down to the bone—\"\n \n Burnett swallowed and didn't say anything more, but he closed his eyes. He stood there, smelling the death-odor in the hot air of the ship, hearing the chug-chug-chug of the blood pumps down below, and his own heart waiting warm and heavy at the base of his throat.\n \n \"This is my last cargo, Rice. I can't take it any longer. And I don't care much how I go back to earth. This Venusian here—what's his name? Lethla. He's number ninety-eight. Shove me into shelf ninety-nine beside him and get the hell home. That's how I feel!\"\n \n Rice was going to say something, but he didn't have time.\n \n Lethla was alive.\n \n He rose from the floor with slow, easy movements, almost like a dream. He didn't say anything. The heat-blast in his white fingers did all the necessary talking. It didn't say anything either, but Burnett knew what language it would use if it had to.\n \n Burnett swallowed hard. The body had looked funny. Too dead. Now he knew why. Involuntarily, Burnett moved forward. Lethla moved like a pale spider, flicking his fragile arm to cover Burnett, the gun in it like a dead cold star.\n \n Rice sucked in his breath. Burnett forced himself to take it easy. From the corners of his eyes he saw Rice's expression go deep and tight, biting lines into his sharp face.\n \n Rice got it out, finally. \"How'd you do it?\" he demanded, bitterly.\n\"How'd you live in the void? It's impossible!\"\n \n A crazy thought came ramming down and exploded in Burnett's head. You never catch up with the war!\n \n \n But what if the war catches up with you?\n \n What in hell would Lethla be wanting aboard a morgue ship?\n \n \n\n \n Lethla half-crouched in the midst of the smell of death and the chugging of blood-pumps below. In the silence he reached up with quick fingers, tapped a tiny crystal stud upon the back of his head, and the halves of a microscopically thin chrysalis parted transparently off of his face. He shucked it off, trailing air-tendrils that had been inserted, hidden in the uniform, ending in thin globules of oxygen.\n \n He spoke. Triumph warmed his crystal-thin voice. \"That's how I did it, Earthman.\"\n \n \"Glassite!\" said Rice. \"A face-moulded mask of glassite!\"\n \n Lethla nodded. His milk-blue eyes dilated. \"Very marvelously pared to an unbreakable thickness of one-thirtieth of an inch; worn only on the head. You have to look quickly to notice it, and, unfortunately, viewed as you saw it, outside the ship, floating in the void, not discernible at all.\"\n \n Prickles of sweat appeared on Rice's face. He swore at the Venusian and the Venusian laughed like some sort of stringed instrument, high and quick.\n \n Burnett laughed, too. Ironically. \"First time in years a man ever came aboard the Constellation alive. It's a welcome change.\"\n \n Lethla showed his needle-like teeth. \"I thought it might be. Where's your radio?\"\n \n \"Go find it!\" snapped Rice, hotly.\n \n \"I will.\" One hand, blue-veined, on the ladder-rungs, Lethla paused.\n\"I know you're weaponless; Purple Cross regulations. And this air-lock is safe. Don't move.\" Whispering, his naked feet padded white up the ladder. Two long breaths later something crashed; metal and glass and coils. The radio.\n \n Burnett put his shoulder blades against the wall-metal, looking at his feet. When he glanced up, Rice's fresh, animated face was spoiled by the new bitterness in it.\n \n Lethla came down. Like a breath of air on the rungs.\n \n He smiled. \"That's better. Now. We can talk—\"\n \n Rice said it, slow:\n \n \"Interplanetary law declares it straight, Lethla! Get out! Only dead men belong here.\"\n \n Lethla's gun grip tightened. \"More talk of that nature, and only dead men there will be.\" He blinked. \"But first—we must rescue Kriere....\"\n \n \"Kriere!\" Rice acted as if he had been hit in the jaw.\n \n Burnett moved his tongue back and forth on his lips silently, his eyes lidded, listening to the two of them as if they were a radio drama. Lethla's voice came next:\n \n \"Rather unfortunately, yes. He's still alive, heading toward Venus at an orbital velocity of two thousand m.p.h., wearing one of these air-chrysali. Enough air for two more hours. Our flag ship was attacked unexpectedly yesterday near Mars. We were forced to take to the life-boats, scattering, Kriere and I in one, the others sacrificing their lives to cover our escape. We were lucky. We got through the Earth cordon unseen. But luck can't last forever.\n \n \"We saw your morgue ship an hour ago. It's a long, long way to Venus. We were running out of fuel, food, water. Radio was broken. Capture was certain. You were coming our way; we took the chance. We set a small time-bomb to destroy the life-rocket, and cast off, wearing our chrysali-helmets. It was the first time we had ever tried using them to trick anyone. We knew you wouldn't know we were alive until it was too late and we controlled your ship. We knew you picked up all bodies for brief exams, returning alien corpses to space later.\"\n \n Rice's voice was sullen. \"A set-up for you, huh? Traveling under the protection of the Purple Cross you can get your damned All-Mighty safe to Venus.\"\n \n Lethla bowed slightly. \"Who would suspect a Morgue Rocket of providing safe hiding for precious Venusian cargo?\"\n \n \"Precious is the word for you, brother!\" said Rice.\n \n \"Enough!\" Lethla moved his gun several inches.\n \n \"Accelerate toward Venus, mote-detectors wide open. Kriere must be picked up— now! \"\n \n \n\n \n Rice didn't move. Burnett moved first, feeling alive for the first time in years. \"Sure,\" said Sam, smiling. \"We'll pick him up.\"\n \n \"No tricks,\" said Lethla.\n \n Burnett scowled and smiled together. \"No tricks. You'll have Kriere on board the Constellation in half an hour or I'm no coroner.\"\n \n \"Follow me up the ladder.\"\n \n Lethla danced up, turned, waved his gun. \"Come on.\"\n \n Burnett went up, quick. Almost as if he enjoyed doing Lethla a favor. Rice grumbled and cursed after him.\n \n On the way up, Burnett thought about it. About Lethla poised like a white feather at the top, holding death in his hand. You never knew whose body would come in through the star-port next. Number ninety-eight was Lethla. Number ninety-nine would be Kriere.\n \n There were two shelves numbered and empty. They should be filled. And what more proper than that Kriere and Lethla should fill them? But, he chewed his lip, that would need a bit of doing. And even then the cargo wouldn't be full. Still one more body to get; one hundred. And you never knew who it would be.\n \n He came out of the quick thoughts when he looped his long leg over the hole-rim, stepped up, faced Lethla in a cramped control room that was one glittering swirl of silver levers, audio-plates and visuals. Chronometers, clicking, told of the steady dropping toward the sun at a slow pace.\n \n Burnett set his teeth together, bone against bone. Help Kriere escape? See him safely to Venus, and then be freed? Sounded easy, wouldn't be hard. Venusians weren't blind with malice. Rice and he could come out alive; if they cooperated.\n \n But there were a lot of warriors sleeping on a lot of numbered shelves in the dim corridors of the long years. And their dead lips were stirring to life in Burnett's ears. Not so easily could they be ignored.\n  You may never catch up with the war again.\n \n \n The last trip!\n \n Yes, this could be it. Capture Kriere and end the war. But what ridiculous fantasy was it made him believe he could actually do it?\n \n Two muscles moved on Burnett, one in each long cheek. The sag in his body vanished as he tautened his spine, flexed his lean-sinewed arms, wet thin lips.\n \n \"Now, where do you want this crate?\" he asked Lethla easily.\n \n Lethla exhaled softly. \"Cooperation. I like it. You're wise, Earthman.\"\n \n \"Very,\" said Burnett.\n \n He was thinking about three thousand eternal nights of young bodies being ripped, slaughtered, flung to the vacuum tides. Ten years of hating a job and hoping that some day there would be a last trip and it would all be over.\n \n Burnett laughed through his nose. Controls moved under his fingers like fluid; loved, caressed, tended by his familiar touching. Looking ahead, he squinted.\n \n \"There's your Ruler now, Lethla. Doing somersaults. Looks dead. A good trick.\"\n \n \"Cut power! We don't want to burn him!\"\n \n \n\n \n Burnett cut. Kriere's milky face floated dreamily into a visual-screen, eyes sealed, lips gaping, hands sagging, clutching emptily at the stars.\n \n \"We're about fifty miles from him, catching up.\" Burnett turned to Lethla with an intent scowl. Funny. This was the first and the last time anybody would ever board the Constellation alive. His stomach went flat, tautened with sudden weakening fear.\n \n If Kriere could be captured, that meant the end of the war, the end of shelves stacked with sleeping warriors, the end of this blind searching. Kriere, then, had to be taken aboard. After that—\n \n Kriere, the All-Mighty. At whose behest all space had quivered like a smitten gong for part of a century. Kriere, revolving in his neat, water-blue uniform, emblems shining gold, heat-gun tucked in glossy jet holster. With Kriere aboard, chances of overcoming him would be eliminated. Now: Rice and Burnett against Lethla. Lethla favored because of his gun.\n \n Kriere would make odds impossible.\n \n Something had to be done before Kriere came in.\n \n Lethla had to be yanked off guard. Shocked, bewildered, fooled—somehow. But—how?\n \n Burnett's jaw froze tight. He could feel a spot on his shoulder-blade where Lethla would send a bullet crashing into rib, sinew, artery—heart.\n \n There was a way. And there was a weapon. And the war would be over and this would be the last trip.\n \n Sweat covered his palms in a nervous smear.\n \n \"Steady, Rice,\" he said, matter of factly. With the rockets cut, there was too much silence, and his voice sounded guilty standing up alone in the center of that silence. \"Take controls, Rice. I'll manipulate the star-port.\"\n \n Burnett slipped from the control console. Rice replaced him grimly. Burnett strode to the next console of levers. That spot on his back kept aching like it was sear-branded X. For the place where the bullet sings and rips. And if you turn quick, catching it in the arm first, why—\n \n Kriere loomed bigger, a white spider delicately dancing on a web of stars. His eyes flicked open behind the glassite sheath, and saw the Constellation . Kriere smiled. His hands came up. He knew he was about to be rescued.\n \n Burnett smiled right back at him. What Kriere didn't know was that he was about to end a ten-years' war.\n \n There was only one way of drawing Lethla off guard, and it had to be fast.\n \n Burnett jabbed a purple-topped stud. The star-port clashed open as it had done a thousand times before; but for the first time it was a good sound. And out of the star-port, at Sam Burnett's easily fingered directions, slid the long claw-like mechanism that picked up bodies from space.\n \n Lethla watched, intent and cold and quiet. The gun was cold and quiet, too.\n \n The claw glided toward Kriere without a sound, now, dream-like in its slowness.\n \n It reached Kriere.\n \n Burnett inhaled a deep breath.\n \n The metal claw cuddled Kriere in its shiny palm.\n \n \n\n \n Lethla watched.\n \n He watched while Burnett exhaled, touched another lever and said: \"You know, Lethla, there's an old saying that only dead men come aboard the Constellation . I believe it.\"\n \n \n\n \n And the claw closed as Burnett spoke, closed slowly and certainly, all around Kriere, crushing him into a ridiculous posture of silence. There was blood running on the claw, and the only recognizable part was the head, which was carefully preserved for identification.\n \n That was the only way to draw Lethla off guard.\n \n Burnett spun about and leaped.\n \n The horror on Lethla's face didn't go away as he fired his gun.\n \n Rice came in fighting, too, but not before something like a red-hot ramrod stabbed Sam Burnett, catching him in the ribs, spinning him back like a drunken idiot to fall in a corner.\n \n Fists made blunt flesh noises. Lethla went down, weaponless and screaming. Rice kicked. After awhile Lethla quit screaming, and the room swam around in Burnett's eyes, and he closed them tight and started laughing.\n \n He didn't finish laughing for maybe ten minutes. He heard the retriever claws come inside, and the star-port grind shut.\n \n Out of the red darkness, Rice's voice came and then he could see Rice's young face over him. Burnett groaned.\n \n Rice said, \"Sam, you shouldn't have done it. You shouldn't have, Sam.\"\n \n \"To hell with it.\" Burnett winced, and fought to keep his eyes open. Something wet and sticky covered his chest. \"I said this was my last trip and I meant it. One way or the other, I'd have quit!\"\n \n \"This is the hard way—\"\n \n \"Maybe. I dunno. Kind of nice to think of all those kids who'll never have to come aboard the Constellation , though, Rice.\" His voice trailed off. \"You watch the shelves fill up and you never know who'll be next. Who'd have thought, four days ago—\"\n \n Something happened to his tongue so it felt like hard ice blocking his mouth. He had a lot more words to say, but only time to get a few of them out:\n \n \"Rice?\"\n \n \"Yeah, Sam?\"\n \n \"We haven't got a full cargo, boy.\"\n \n \"Full enough for me, sir.\"\n \n \"But still not full. If we went back to Center Base without filling the shelves, it wouldn't be right. Look there—number ninety-eight is Lethla—number ninety-nine is Kriere. Three thousand days of rolling this rocket, and not once come back without a bunch of the kids who want to sleep easy on the good green earth. Not right to be going back any way—but—the way—we used to—\"\n \n His voice got all full of fog. As thick as the fists of a dozen warriors. Rice was going away from him. Rice was standing still, and Burnett was lying down, not moving, but somehow Rice was going away a million miles.\n \n \"Ain't I one hell of a patriot, Rice?\"\n \n Then everything got dark except Rice's face. And that was starting to dissolve.\n \n Ninety-eight: Lethla. Ninety-nine: Kriere.\n \n He could still see Rice standing over him for a long time, breathing out and in. Down under the tables the blood-pumps pulsed and pulsed, thick and slow. Rice looked down at Burnett and then at the empty shelf at the far end of the room, and then back at Burnett again.\n \n And then he said softly:\n \n \" One hundred. \"", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "63041", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n Granthan's mission was the most vital of the war. It would mean instant victory—but for whom?\n \n \n\n I\n \n In the dream I was swimming in a river of white fire and the dream went on and on. And then I was awake—and the fire was still there, fiercely burning at me.\n \n I tried to move to get away from the flames, and then the real pain hit me. I tried to go back to sleep and the relative comfort of the river of fire, but it was no go. For better or worse, I was alive and conscious.\n \n I opened my eyes and took a look around. I was on the floor next to an unpadded acceleration couch—the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm installs in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but no one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a lot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it. I took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare, but the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the cracks where the crisped upper layers had burst....\n \n There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I tried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation that transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with the charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek up Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the microswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was fading out again....\n \n \n\n \n I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but reasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put up a hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been a fracture. The left arm—well, it was still there, wrapped to the shoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scar tissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as the truss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying at leisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn't complaining.\n \n As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with the Gool—if I survived.\n \n I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on the condition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It was dogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been at work.\n \n I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition—with a broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull—I shouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip from Belshazzar's CCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that port shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But running on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers and thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was here—and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.\n \n I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before. It was almost five minutes before the \"acknowledge\" came through from the Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face swam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the haggard look.\n \n \"Granthan!\" he burst out. \"Where are the others? What happened out there?\" I turned him down to a mutter.\n \n \"Hold on,\" I said. \"I'll tell you. Recorders going?\" I didn't wait for an answer—not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:\n \n \" Belshazzar was sabotaged. So was Gilgamesh —I think. I got out. I lost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the Med people the drinks are on me.\"\n \n I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the screen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile as a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would get his reaction to my report. I dozed off—and awoke with a start. Kayle was talking.\n \n \"—your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in the disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?\"\n \n \"How the hell do I know?\" I yelled—or croaked. But Kayle's voice was droning on:\n \n \"... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may have some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it possible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've told me yourself that you blacked out during the attack—and came to on the lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.\n \n \"This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without warning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the possibility of—what's that term you use?—hyper-cortical invasion. You know better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to pass the patrol line.\n \n \"I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept the risk.\"\n \n \"What do I do now?\" I stormed. \"Go into orbit and eat pills and hope you think of something? I need a doctor!\"\n \n Presently Kayle replied. \"Yes,\" he said. \"You'll have to enter a parking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make it possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation.\" He didn't meet my eye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of knowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing what he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and pretend—right up until the warheads struck—that I didn't know I'd been condemned to death.\n \n \n\n II\n \n I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I was alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a converging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery range of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive my next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I was acting under Gool orders.\n \n I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan, psychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks earlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were mine, all mine....\n \n But how could I be sure of that?\n \n Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as skillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of their tampering—not at a conscious level.\n \n But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting like any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I wasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the mind—and I had been prepared for just such an attack.\n \n Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one resource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious—and see again what had happened.\n \n I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on the trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....\n \n Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a first-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty surface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in their limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke through into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of mirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....\n \n \n\n \n The immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay before me. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring personality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional continuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.\n \n And found it.\n \n As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity of static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the probing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried motivations.\n \n I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.\n \n \" It is a contact, Effulgent One! \"\n \n \" Softly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at the threshold.... \"\n \n \" It is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating trough! \"\n \n A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the voices—yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably intricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had concretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought against the intruding stimuli—then yielded under the relentless thrust of the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor centers, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated control compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking the way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me—and then the hatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg. My blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as the lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought—and the world-ending impact as I fell.\n \n At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality lashed out again—fighting the invader.\n \n \" Almost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one! \"\n \n \" Impossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expend the last filament of your life-force! \"\n \n Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention are instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction followed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in my subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its passage, to leave me unaware of its tampering—at a conscious level.\n \n Watching the Gool mind, I learned.\n \n The insinuating probe—a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had theorized—was no more than a pattern in emptiness....\n \n But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had been done to me.\n \n Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping and manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin crystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning themselves.\n \n Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand to pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable void—and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a glistening dark shape.\n \n There was a soundless shriek. \" Effulgence! It reached out—touched me! \"\n \n \n\n \n Using the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck, stifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled the obscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzy of xenophobia—a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.\n \n I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering. Not pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact, tracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....\n \n I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. There was a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some inner source, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at its rim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for a more favorable position.\n \n \n\n \n I probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue that linked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I traced the passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns where smaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memory told me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets that would transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord had discovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphur alone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals—riches beyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribe cluster—those who remained of a once-great race—at a single feeding trough. They would spread out across a galaxy—and beyond.\n \n But not if I could help it.\n \n The Gool had evolved a plan—but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.\n \n In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, among the fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough, perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a man back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.\n \n Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter of the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a psychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened the fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see what I could steal.\n \n A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light and white sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts, fared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of the concepts of an alien mind.\n \n I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern within pattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.\n \n I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, its meaning exploded in my mind.\n \n From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world in its lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret of their kind.\n \n Matter across space.\n \n \n\n \n \"You've got to listen to me, Kayle,\" I shouted. \"I know you think I'm a Gool robot. But what I have is too big to let you blow it up without a fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. The concept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to take my word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plus an infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil—and a few other things....\"\n \n I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I was getting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my screens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.\n \n Kayle came back—and his answer boiled down to \"no.\"\n \n I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself for the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the cross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits to the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I talked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the ego-complex.\n \n I might have saved my breath.\n \n \"I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,\" he snapped.\n\"It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to you well enough. I'm sorry.\"\n \n I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind thoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the problem at hand.\n \n I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the reference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor stations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat the size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a daring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.\n \n And I had a few ideas.\n \n \n\n III\n \n The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a wild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized it was the routine DEW line patrol contact.\n \n \"Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee preparatory to picking up approach orbit....\"\n \n The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the autopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout was moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.\n \n I closed my eyes, reached out—as the Gool mind had reached out to me—and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand miles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of struggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched keys, spoke into his microphone:\n \n \"As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen seconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.\"\n \n I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his belated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line now, rapidly approaching atmosphere.\n \n \"Z four-oh-two,\" the speaker crackled. \"This is planetary control. I am picking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.\"\n \n There was a long pause. Then:\n \n \"Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance countermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code ninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!\"\n \n It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line of defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it dumb, and hope for a little luck.\n \n \"Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that, fellows. I'm a little banged up—I guess I switched frequencies on you. What was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?\"\n \n \"Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!\"\n \n \"Hey, you birds are mixed up,\" I protested. \"I'm cleared all the way. I checked in with DEW—\"\n \n It was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit the controls, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out—\n \n A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose from his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar screens blanked off....\n \n For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after attack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles southeast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up, over, buffeting me against the restraining harness.\n \n I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy disorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking lifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on the water.\n \n I would have to risk calling Kayle now—but by voluntarily giving my position away, I should convince him I was still on our side—and I was badly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key.\n \n \"This is Z four-oh-two,\" I said. \"I have an urgent report for Colonel Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence.\"\n \n Kayle's face appeared. \"Don't fight it, Granthan,\" he croaked. \"You penetrated the planetary defenses—God knows how. I—\"\n \n \"Later,\" I snapped. \"How about calling off your dogs now? And send somebody out here to pick me up, before I add sea-sickness to my other complaints.\"\n \n \"We have you pinpointed,\" Kayle cut in. \"It's no use fighting it, Granthan.\"\n \n \n\n \n I felt cold sweat pop out on my forehead. \"You've got to listen, Kayle,\" I shouted. \"I suppose you've got missiles on the way already. Call them back! I have information that can win the war—\"\n \n \"I'm sorry, Granthan,\" Kayle said. \"It's too late—even if I could take the chance you were right.\"\n \n A different face appeared on the screen.\n \n \"Mr. Granthan, I am General Titus. On behalf of your country, and in the name of the President—who has been apprised of this tragic situation—it is my privilege to inform you that you will be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor—posthumously—for your heroic effort. Although you failed, and have in fact been forced, against your will, to carry out the schemes of the inhuman enemy, this in no way detracts from your gallant attempt. Mr. Granthan, I salute you.\"\n \n The general's arm went up in a rigid gesture.\n \n \"Stow that, you pompous idiot!\" I barked. \"I'm no spy!\"\n \n Kayle was back, blanking out the startled face of the general.\n \n \"Goodbye, Granthan. Try to understand....\"\n \n I flipped the switch, sat gripping the couch, my stomach rising with each heave of the floating escape capsule. I had perhaps five minutes. The missiles would be from Canaveral.\n \n I closed my eyes, forced myself to relax, reached out....\n \n I sensed the distant shore, the hot buzz of human minds at work in the cities. I followed the coastline, found the Missile Base, flicked through the cluster of minds.\n \n \"— missile on course; do right, baby. That's it, right in the slot. \"\n \n I fingered my way through the man's mind and found the control centers. He turned stiffly from the plotting board, tottered to a panel to slam his hand against the destruct button.\n \n Men fell on him, dragged him back. \"— fool, why did you blow it? \"\n \n I dropped the contact, found another, who leaped to the panel, detonated the remainder of the flight of six missiles. Then I withdrew. I would have a few minutes' stay of execution now.\n \n I was ten miles from shore. The capsule had its own power plant. I started it up, switched on the external viewer. I saw dark sea, the glint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow on the horizon that would be Key West. I plugged the course into the pilot, then leaned back and felt outward with my mind for the next attacker.\n \n \n\n IV\n \n It was dark in the trainyard. I moved along the tracks in a stumbling walk. Just a few more minutes, I was telling myself. A few more minutes and you can lie down ... rest....\n \n \n The shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blacker square. I leaned against the sill, breathing hard, then reached inside for a grip with my good hand.\n \n Gravel scrunched nearby. The beam of a flashlight lanced out, slipped along the weathered car, caught me. There was a startled exclamation. I ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was a confused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from the city all around. It was hard, too hard. I had to sleep—\n \n I heard the snick of a revolver being cocked, and dropped flat as a gout of flame stabbed toward me, the imperative Bam! echoing between the cars. I caught the clear thought:\n \n \"God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right—\"\n \n I reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, went out, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poled steer.\n \n It was easy—if I could only stay awake.\n \n I gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a dark corner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personality fraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warn me of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slide down into darkness.\n \n \n\n \n The car swayed, click-clack, click-clack. I opened my eyes, saw yellow sunlight in a bar across the litter on the floor. The power truss creaked, pulling at my arm. My broken leg was throbbing its indignation at the treatment it had received—walking brace and all—and the burned arm was yelling aloud for more of that nice dope that had been keeping it from realizing how bad it was. All things considered, I felt like a badly embalmed mummy—except that I was hungry. I had been a fool not to fill my pockets when I left the escape capsule in the shallows off Key Largo, but things had been happening too fast.\n \n I had barely made it to the fishing boat, whose owner I had coerced into rendezvousing with me before shells started dropping around us. If the gunners on the cruiser ten miles away had had any luck, they would have finished me—and the hapless fisherman—right then. We rode out a couple of near misses, before I put the cruiser's gunnery crew off the air.\n \n At a fishing camp on the beach, I found a car—with driver. He dropped me at the railyard, and drove off under the impression he was in town for groceries. He'd never believe he'd seen me.\n \n Now I'd had my sleep. I had to start getting ready for the next act of the farce.\n \n I pressed the release on the power truss, gingerly unclamped it, then rigged a sling from a strip of shirt tail. I tied the arm to my side as inconspicuously as possible. I didn't disturb the bandages.\n \n I needed new clothes—or at least different ones—and something to cover my shaved skull. I couldn't stay hidden forever. The yard cop had recognized me at a glance.\n \n I lay back, waiting for the train to slow for a town. I wasn't unduly worried—at the moment. The watchman probably hadn't convinced anyone he'd actually seen me. Maybe he hadn't been too sure himself.\n \n The click-clack slowed and the train shuddered to a stop. I crept to the door, peered through the crack. There were sunny fields, a few low buildings in the distance, the corner of a platform. I closed my eyes and let my awareness stretch out.\n \n \"— lousy job. What's the use? Little witch in the lunch room ... up in the hills, squirrel hunting, bottle of whiskey.... \"\n \n I settled into control gently, trying not to alarm the man. I saw through his eyes the dusty box car, the rust on the tracks, the listless weeds growing among cinders, and the weathered boards of the platform. I turned him, and saw the dingy glass of the telegraph window, a sagging screen door with a chipped enameled cola sign.\n \n I walked the man to the door, and through it. Behind a linoleum-topped counter, a coarse-skinned teen-age girl with heavy breasts and wet patches under her arms looked up without interest as the door banged.\n \n My host went on to the counter, gestured toward the waxed-paper-wrapped sandwiches under a glass cover. \"I'll take 'em all. And candy bars, and cigarettes. And give me a big glass of water.\"\n \n \"Better git out there and look after yer train,\" the girl said carelessly. \"When'd you git so all-fired hungry all of a sudden?\"\n \n \"Put it in a bag. Quick.\"\n \n \"Look who's getting bossy—\"\n \n My host rounded the counter, picked up a used paper bag, began stuffing food in it. The girl stared at him, then pushed him back. \"You git back around that counter!\"\n \n She filled the bag, took a pencil from behind her ear.\n \n \"That'll be one eighty-five. Cash.\"\n \n My host took two dog-eared bills from his shirt pocket, dropped them on the counter and waited while the girl filled a glass. He picked it up and started out.\n \n \"Hey! Where you goin' with my glass?\"\n \n The trainman crossed the platform, headed for the boxcar. He slid the loose door back a few inches against the slack latch, pushed the bag inside, placed the glass of water beside it, then pulled off his grimy railroader's cap and pushed it through the opening. He turned. The girl watched from the platform. A rattle passed down the line and the train started up with a lurch. The man walked back toward the girl. I heard him say: \"Friend o' mine in there—just passin' through.\"\n \n I was discovering that it wasn't necessary to hold tight control over every move of a subject. Once given the impulse to act, he would rationalize his behavior, fill in the details—and never know that the original idea hadn't been his own.\n \n I drank the water first, ate a sandwich, then lit a cigarette and lay back. So far so good. The crates in the car were marked \"U. S. Naval Aerospace Station, Bayou Le Cochon\". With any luck I'd reach New Orleans in another twelve hours. The first step of my plan included a raid on the Delta National Labs; but that was tomorrow. That could wait.\n \n \n\n \n It was a little before dawn when I crawled out of the car at a siding in the swampy country a few miles out of New Orleans. I wasn't feeling good, but I had a stake in staying on my feet. I still had a few miles in me. I had my supplies—a few candy bars and some cigarettes—stuffed in the pockets of the tattered issue coverall. Otherwise, I was unencumbered. Unless you wanted to count the walking brace on my right leg and the sling binding my arm.\n \n I picked my way across mushy ground to a pot-holed black-top road, started limping toward a few car lights visible half a mile away. It was already hot. The swamp air was like warmed-over subway fumes. Through the drugs, I could feel my pulse throbbing in my various wounds. I reached out and touched the driver's mind; he was thinking about shrimps, a fish-hook wound on his left thumb and a girl with black hair. \"Want a lift?\" he called.\n \n I thanked him and got in. He gave me a glance and I pinched off his budding twinge of curiosity. It was almost an effort now not to follow his thoughts. It was as though my mind, having learned the trick of communications with others, instinctively reached out toward them.\n \n An hour later he dropped me on a street corner in a shabby marketing district of the city and drove off. I hoped he made out all right with the dark-haired girl. I spotted a used-clothing store and headed for it.\n \n Twenty minutes later I was back on the sidewalk, dressed in a pinkish-gray suit that had been cut a long time ago by a Latin tailor—maybe to settle a grudge. The shirt that went with it was an unsuccessful violet. The black string tie lent a dubious air of distinction. I'd swapped the railroader's cap for a tarnished beret. The man who had supplied the outfit was still asleep. I figured I'd done him a favor by taking it. I couldn't hope to pass for a fisherman—I wasn't the type. Maybe I'd get by as a coffee-house derelict.\n \n I walked past fly-covered fish stalls, racks of faded garments, grimy vegetables in bins, enough paint-flaked wrought iron to cage a herd of brontosauri, and fetched up at a cab stand. I picked a fat driver with a wart.\n \n \"How much to the Delta National Laboratories?\"\n \n He rolled an eye toward me, shifted his toothpick.\n \n \"What ya wanna go out there for? Nothing out there.\"\n \n \"I'm a tourist,\" I said. \"They told me before I left home not to miss it.\"\n \n He grunted, reached back and opened the door. I got in. He flipped his flag down, started up with a clash of gears and pulled out without looking.\n \n \"How far is it?\" I asked him.\n \n \"It ain't far. Mile, mile and a quarter.\"\n \n \"Pretty big place, I guess.\"\n \n He didn't answer.\n \n We went through a warehousing district, swung left along the waterfront, bumped over railroad tracks, and pulled up at a nine-foot cyclone fence with a locked gate.\n \n \"A buck ten,\" my driver said.\n \n I looked out at the fence, a barren field, a distant group of low buildings. \"What's this?\"\n \n \"This is the place you ast for. That'll be a buck ten, mister.\"\n \n I touched his mind, planted a couple of false impressions and withdrew. He blinked, then started up, drove around the field, pulled up at an open gate with a blue-uniformed guard. He looked back at me.\n \n \"You want I should drive in, sir?\"\n \n \"I'll get out here.\"\n \n He jumped out, opened my door, helped me out with a hand under my good elbow. \"I'll get your change, sir,\" he said, reaching for his hip.\n \n \"Keep it.\"\n \n \"Thank YOU.\" He hesitated. \"Maybe I oughta stick around. You know.\"\n \n \"I'll be all right.\"\n \n \"I hope so,\" he said. \"A man like you—you and me—\" he winked. \"After all, we ain't both wearing berets fer nothing.\"\n \n \"True,\" I said. \"Consider your tip doubled. Now drive away into the sunrise and forget you ever saw me.\"", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "51267", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n Actually, there wouldn't be too much difference if women took over the Earth altogether. But not for some men and most boys!\n \n \n \n I've always said that even if Sis is seven years older than me—and a girl besides—she don't always know what's best. Put me on a spaceship jam-packed with three hundred females just aching to get themselves husbands in the one place they're still to be had—the planet Venus—and you know I'll be in trouble.\n \n Bad trouble. With the law, which is the worst a boy can get into.\n \n Twenty minutes after we lifted from the Sahara Spaceport, I wriggled out of my acceleration hammock and started for the door of our cabin.\n \n \"Now you be careful, Ferdinand,\" Sis called after me as she opened a book called Family Problems of the Frontier Woman . \"Remember you're a nice boy. Don't make me ashamed of you.\"\n \n I tore down the corridor. Most of the cabins had purple lights on in front of the doors, showing that the girls were still inside their hammocks. That meant only the ship's crew was up and about. Ship's crews are men; women are too busy with important things like government to run ships. I felt free all over—and happy. Now was my chance to really see the Eleanor Roosevelt !\n \n \n\n \n It was hard to believe I was traveling in space at last. Ahead and behind me, all the way up to where the companionway curved in out of sight, there was nothing but smooth black wall and smooth white doors—on and on and on. Gee , I thought excitedly, this is one big ship !\n \n Of course, every once in a while I would run across a big scene of stars in the void set in the wall; but they were only pictures. Nothing that gave the feel of great empty space like I'd read about in The Boy Rocketeers , no portholes, no visiplates, nothing.\n \n So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then turned left. To the right, see, there was Deck Four, then Deck Three, leading inward past the engine fo'c'sle to the main jets and the grav helix going purr-purr-purrty-purr in the comforting way big machinery has when it's happy and oiled. But to the left, the crossway led all the way to the outside level which ran just under the hull. There were portholes on the hull.\n \n I'd studied all that out in our cabin, long before we'd lifted, on the transparent model of the ship hanging like a big cigar from the ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but she was looking for places like the dining salon and the library and Lifeboat 68 where we should go in case of emergency. I looked for the important things.\n \n As I trotted along the crossway, I sort of wished that Sis hadn't decided to go after a husband on a luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now, I'd be climbing from deck to deck on a ladder instead of having gravity underfoot all the time just like I was home on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy can only make faces and do what they say, same as the men have to do.\n \n Still, it was pretty exciting to press my nose against the slots in the wall and see the sliding panels that could come charging out and block the crossway into an airtight fit in case a meteor or something smashed into the ship. And all along there were glass cases with spacesuits standing in them, like those knights they used to have back in the Middle Ages.\n \n \"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of companionway,\" they had the words etched into the glass, \"break glass with hammer upon wall, remove spacesuit and proceed to don it in the following fashion.\"\n \n I read the \"following fashion\" until I knew it by heart. Boy , I said to myself, I hope we have that kind of disaster. I'd sure like to get into one of those! Bet it would be more fun than those diving suits back in Undersea!\n \n \n And all the time I was alone. That was the best part.\n \n \n\n \n Then I passed Deck Twelve and there was a big sign. \"Notice! Passengers not permitted past this point!\" A big sign in red.\n \n I peeked around the corner. I knew it—the next deck was the hull. I could see the portholes. Every twelve feet, they were, filled with the velvet of space and the dancing of more stars than I'd ever dreamed existed in the Universe.\n \n There wasn't anyone on the deck, as far as I could see. And this distance from the grav helix, the ship seemed mighty quiet and lonely. If I just took one quick look....\n \n But I thought of what Sis would say and I turned around obediently. Then I saw the big red sign again. \"Passengers not permitted—\"\n \n Well! Didn't I know from my civics class that only women could be Earth Citizens these days? Sure, ever since the Male Desuffrage Act. And didn't I know that you had to be a citizen of a planet in order to get an interplanetary passport? Sis had explained it all to me in the careful, patient way she always talks politics and things like that to men.\n \n \"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the only passenger in our family. You can't be one, because, not being a citizen, you can't acquire an Earth Passport. However, you'll be going to Venus on the strength of this clause—'Miss Evelyn Sparling and all dependent male members of family, this number not to exceed the registered quota of sub-regulations pertaining'—and so on. I want you to understand these matters, so that you will grow into a man who takes an active interest in world affairs. No matter what you hear, women really like and appreciate such men.\"\n \n Of course, I never pay much attention to Sis when she says such dumb things. I'm old enough, I guess, to know that it isn't what Women like and appreciate that counts when it comes to people getting married. If it were, Sis and three hundred other pretty girls like her wouldn't be on their way to Venus to hook husbands.\n \n Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the sign didn't have anything to do with me. I knew what Sis could say to that , but at least it was an argument I could use if it ever came up. So I broke the law.\n \n I was glad I did. The stars were exciting enough, but away off to the left, about five times as big as I'd ever seen it, except in the movies, was the Moon, a great blob of gray and white pockmarks holding off the black of space. I was hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it must be on the other side of the ship or behind us. I pressed my nose against the port and saw the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off, Marsbound. I wished I was on that one!\n \n Then I noticed, a little farther down the companionway, a stretch of blank wall where there should have been portholes. High up on the wall in glowing red letters were the words, \"Lifeboat 47. Passengers: Thirty-two. Crew: Eleven. Unauthorized personnel keep away!\"\n \n Another one of those signs.\n \n \n\n \n I crept up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make out the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I walked under the sign and tried to figure the way you were supposed to get into it. There was a very thin line going around in a big circle that I knew must be the door. But I couldn't see any knobs or switches to open it with. Not even a button you could press.\n \n That meant it was a sonic lock like the kind we had on the outer keeps back home in Undersea. But knock or voice? I tried the two knock combinations I knew, and nothing happened. I only remembered one voice key—might as well see if that's it, I figured.\n \n \"Twenty, Twenty-three. Open Sesame.\"\n \n For a second, I thought I'd hit it just right out of all the million possible combinations—The door clicked inward toward a black hole, and a hairy hand as broad as my shoulders shot out of the hole. It closed around my throat and plucked me inside as if I'd been a baby sardine.\n \n I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath and sat up, the door had been shut again. When the light came on, I found myself staring up the muzzle of a highly polished blaster and into the cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen.\n \n \n\n \n He was wearing a one-piece suit made of some scaly green stuff that looked hard and soft at the same time.\n \n His boots were made of it too, and so was the hood hanging down his back.\n \n And his face was brown. Not just ordinary tan, you understand, but the deep, dark, burned-all-the-way-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards in New Orleans whenever we took a surface vacation—the kind of tan that comes from day after broiling day under a really hot Sun. His hair looked as if it had once been blond, but now there were just long combed-out waves with a yellowish tinge that boiled all the way down to his shoulders.\n \n I hadn't seen hair like that on a man except maybe in history books; every man I'd ever known had his hair cropped in the fashionable soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting about the blaster which I knew it was against the law for him to have at all, when I suddenly got scared right through.\n \n His eyes.\n \n They didn't blink and there seemed to be no expression around them. Just coldness. Maybe it was the kind of clothes he was wearing that did it, but all of a sudden I was reminded of a crocodile I'd seen in a surface zoo that had stared quietly at me for twenty minutes until it opened two long tooth-studded jaws.\n \n \"Green shatas!\" he said suddenly. \"Only a tadpole. I must be getting jumpy enough to splash.\"\n \n Then he shoved the blaster away in a holster made of the same scaly leather, crossed his arms on his chest and began to study me. I grunted to my feet, feeling a lot better. The coldness had gone out of his eyes.\n \n I held out my hand the way Sis had taught me. \"My name is Ferdinand Sparling. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr.—Mr.—\"\n \n \"Hope for your sake,\" he said to me, \"that you aren't what you seem—tadpole brother to one of them husbandless anura.\"\n \n \" What? \"\n \n \"A 'nuran is a female looking to nest. Anura is a herd of same. Come from Flatfolk ways.\"\n \n \"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they? Are you a Venusian? What part of Venus do you come from? Why did you say you hope—\"\n \n He chuckled and swung me up into one of the bunks that lined the lifeboat. \"Questions you ask,\" he said in his soft voice. \"Venus is a sharp enough place for a dryhorn, let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a boss-minded sister.\"\n \n \"I'm not a dryleg,\" I told him proudly. \" We're from Undersea.\"\n \n \" Dryhorn , I said, not dryleg. And what's Undersea?\"\n \n \"Well, in Undersea we called foreigners and newcomers drylegs. Just like on Venus, I guess, you call them dryhorns.\" And then I told him how Undersea had been built on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, when the mineral resources of the land began to give out and engineers figured that a lot could still be reached from the sea bottoms.\n \n \n\n \n He nodded. He'd heard about the sea-bottom mining cities that were bubbling under protective domes in every one of the Earth's oceans just about the same time settlements were springing up on the planets.\n \n He looked impressed when I told him about Mom and Pop being one of the first couples to get married in Undersea. He looked thoughtful when I told him how Sis and I had been born there and spent half our childhood listening to the pressure pumps. He raised his eyebrows and looked disgusted when I told how Mom, as Undersea representative on the World Council, had been one of the framers of the Male Desuffrage Act after the Third Atomic War had resulted in the Maternal Revolution.\n \n \n\n \n He almost squeezed my arm when I got to the time Mom and Pop were blown up in a surfacing boat.\n \n \"Well, after the funeral, there was a little money, so Sis decided we might as well use it to migrate. There was no future for her on Earth, she figured. You know, the three-out-of-four.\"\n \n \"How's that?\"\n \n \"The three-out-of-four. No more than three women out of every four on Earth can expect to find husbands. Not enough men to go around. Way back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, Sis says, what with the wars and all. Then the wars went on and a lot more men began to die or get no good from the radioactivity. Then the best men went to the planets, Sis says, until by now even if a woman can scrounge a personal husband, he's not much to boast about.\"\n \n The stranger nodded violently. \"Not on Earth, he isn't. Those busybody anura make sure of that. What a place! Suffering gridniks, I had a bellyful!\"\n \n He told me about it. Women were scarce on Venus, and he hadn't been able to find any who were willing to come out to his lonely little islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there was supposed to be a surplus. Naturally, having been born and brought up on a very primitive planet, he didn't know \"it's a woman's world,\" like the older boys in school used to say.\n \n The moment he landed on Earth he was in trouble. He didn't know he had to register at a government-operated hotel for transient males; he threw a bartender through a thick plastic window for saying something nasty about the length of his hair; and imagine !—he not only resisted arrest, resulting in three hospitalized policemen, but he sassed the judge in open court!\n \n \"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except through female attorneys. Told her that where I came from, a man spoke his piece when he'd a mind to, and his woman walked by his side.\"\n \n \"What happened?\" I asked breathlessly.\n \n \"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up brinosaur took my last munit for fines, then explained that she was remitting the rest because I was a foreigner and uneducated.\" His eyes grew dark for a moment. He chuckled again. \"But I wasn't going to serve all those fancy little prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination, they call it? Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken mother world from my feet forever. The women on it deserve their men. My pockets were folded from the fines, and the paddlefeet were looking for me so close I didn't dare radio for more munit. So I stowed away.\"\n \n \n\n \n For a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was almost ill.\n\"Y-you mean,\" I choked, \"th-that you're b-breaking the law right now? And I'm with you while you're doing it?\"\n \n He leaned over the edge of the bunk and stared at me very seriously.\n\"What breed of tadpole are they turning out these days? Besides, what business do you have this close to the hull?\"\n \n After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. \"You're right. I've also become a male outside the law. We're in this together.\"\n \n He guffawed. Then he sat up and began cleaning his blaster. I found myself drawn to the bright killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis insists such things have always had for men.\n \n \"Ferdinand your label? That's not right for a sprouting tadpole. I'll call you Ford. My name's Butt. Butt Lee Brown.\"\n \n I liked the sound of Ford. \"Is Butt a nickname, too?\"\n \n \"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I haven't found a man who can draw a blaster fast enough to call me that. You see, Pop came over in the eighties—the big wave of immigrants when they evacuated Ontario. Named all us boys after Canadian provinces. I was the youngest, so I got the name they were saving for a girl.\"\n \n \"You had a lot of brothers, Mr. Butt?\"\n \n He grinned with a mighty set of teeth. \"Oh, a nestful. Of course, they were all killed in the Blue Chicago Rising by the MacGregor boys—all except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the MacGregors down. Took a heap of time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down the Tuscany till both of us were pretty near grown up.\"\n \n I walked up close to where I could see the tiny bright copper coils of the blaster above the firing button. \"Have you killed a lot of men with that, Mr. Butt?\"\n \n \"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, Ford.\" He frowned and sighted at the light globe. \"No more'n twelve—not counting five government paddlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it, violence never accomplishes much that's important. My brother Sas, now—\"\n \n \n\n \n He had just begun to work into a wonderful anecdote about his brother when the dinner gong rang. Butt told me to scat. He said I was a growing tadpole and needed my vitamins. And he mentioned, very off-hand, that he wouldn't at all object if I brought him some fresh fruit. It seemed there was nothing but processed foods in the lifeboat and Butt was used to a farmer's diet.\n \n Trouble was, he was a special kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit would have been pretty easy to sneak into my pockets at meals. I even found a way to handle the kelp and giant watercress Mr. Brown liked, but things like seaweed salt and Venusian mud-grapes just had too strong a smell. Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept my jacket for laundering and I had to wash it myself. But I learned so many wonderful things about Venus every time I visited that stowaway....\n \n I learned three wild-wave songs of the Flatfolk and what it is that the native Venusians hate so much; I learned how you tell the difference between a lousy government paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo and the slaptoe slinker who is the planter's friend. After a lot of begging, Butt Lee Brown explained the workings of his blaster, explained it so carefully that I could name every part and tell what it did from the tiny round electrodes to the long spirals of transformer. But no matter what, he would never let me hold it.\n \n \"Sorry, Ford, old tad,\" he would drawl, spinning around and around in the control swivel-chair at the nose of the lifeboat. \"But way I look at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like the giant whose heart was in an egg that an enemy found. When you've grown enough so's your pop feels you ought to have a weapon, why, then's the time to learn it and you might's well learn fast. Before then, you're plain too young to be even near it.\"\n \n \"I don't have a father to give me one when I come of age. I don't even have an older brother as head of my family like your brother Labrador. All I have is Sis. And she —\"\n \n \"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther South than the Polar Coast. And she'll stay head of the family, if I know her breed of green shata. Bossy, opinionated. By the way, Fordie,\" he said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and rippled off his biceps, \"that sister. She ever....\"\n \n And he'd be off again, cross-examining me about Evelyn. I sat in the swivel chair he'd vacated and tried to answer his questions. But there was a lot of stuff I didn't know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, for instance; how healthy, exactly, I had no way of finding out. Yes, I'd tell him, my aunts on both sides of my family each had had more than the average number of children. No, we'd never done any farming to speak of, back in Undersea, but—yes, I'd guess Evelyn knew about as much as any girl there when it came to diving equipment and pressure pump regulation.\n \n How would I know that stuff would lead to trouble for me?\n \n \n\n \n Sis had insisted I come along to the geography lecture. Most of the other girls who were going to Venus for husbands talked to each other during the lecture, but not my sister! She hung on every word, took notes even, and asked enough questions to make the perspiring purser really work in those orientation periods.\n \n \"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling,\" he said with pretty heavy sarcasm,\n\"but I cannot remember any of the agricultural products of the Macro Continent. Since the human population is well below one per thousand square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity of tilled soil, land or sub-surface, is so small that—Wait, I remember something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not exactly an edible one. The wild dunging drug is harvested there by criminal speculators. Contrary to belief on Earth, the traffic has been growing in recent years. In fact—\"\n \n \"Pardon me, sir,\" I broke in, \"but doesn't dunging come only from Leif Erickson Island off the Moscow Peninsula of the Macro Continent? You remember, purser—Wang Li's third exploration, where he proved the island and the peninsula didn't meet for most of the year?\"\n \n The purser nodded slowly. \"I forgot,\" he admitted. \"Sorry, ladies, but the boy's right. Please make the correction in your notes.\"\n \n But Sis was the only one who took notes, and she didn't take that one. She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while I got sicker and sicker. Then she shut her pad with the final gesture of the right hand that Mom used to use just before challenging the opposition to come right down on the Council floor and debate it out with her.\n \n \"Ferdinand,\" Sis said, \"let's go back to our cabin.\"\n \n The moment she sat me down and walked slowly around me, I knew I was in for it. \"I've been reading up on Venusian geography in the ship's library,\" I told her in a hurry.\n \n \"No doubt,\" she said drily. She shook her night-black hair out. \"But you aren't going to tell me that you read about dunging in the ship's library. The books there have been censored by a government agent of Earth against the possibility that they might be read by susceptible young male minds like yours. She would not have allowed—this Terran Agent—\"\n \n \"Paddlefoot,\" I sneered.\n \n Sis sat down hard in our zoom-air chair. \"Now that's a term,\" she said carefully, \"that is used only by Venusian riffraff.\"\n \n \"They're not!\"\n \n \"Not what?\"\n \n \"Riffraff,\" I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the time and not being able to help it. I mustn't give Mr. Brown away!\n\"They're trappers and farmers, pioneers and explorers, who're building Venus. And it takes a real man to build on a hot, hungry hell like Venus.\"\n \n \"Does it, now?\" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning to grow a second pair of ears. \"Tell me more.\"\n \n \"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you start civilization on a new planet. You've got to have men who aren't afraid to make their own law if necessary—with their own guns. That's where law begins; the books get written up later.\"\n \n \"You're going to tell , Ferdinand, what evil, criminal male is speaking through your mouth!\"\n \n \"Nobody!\" I insisted. \"They're my own ideas!\"\n \n \"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A boy who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless entirely masculine boredom with political philosophy. I plan to have a government career on that new planet you talk about, Ferdinand—after I have found a good, steady husband, of course—and I don't look forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, who has been filling your head with all this nonsense?\"\n \n \n\n \n I was sweating. Sis has that deadly bulldog approach when she feels someone is lying. I pulled my pulpast handkerchief from my pocket to wipe my face. Something rattled to the floor.\n \n \"What is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?\"\n \n A trap seemed to be hinging noisily into place. \"One of the passengers wanted to see how you looked in a bathing suit.\"\n \n \"The passengers on this ship are all female. I can't imagine any of them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has been giving you these anti-social ideas, isn't it? A war-mongering masculinist like all the frustrated men who want to engage in government and don't have the vaguest idea how to. Except, of course, in their ancient, bloody ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that sunny and carefree soul of yours?\"\n \n \"Nobody! Nobody! \"\n \n \"Ferdinand, there's no point in lying! I demand—\"\n \n \"I told you, Sis. I told you! And don't call me Ferdinand. Call me Ford.\"\n \n \"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen to me, Ferdinand....\"\n \n After that it was all over but the confession. That came in a few moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She just knew me too well, I decided miserably. Besides, she was a girl.\n \n All the same, I wouldn't get Mr. Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I could help it. I made Sis promise she wouldn't turn him in if I took her to him. And the quick, nodding way she said she would made me feel just a little better.\n \n The door opened on the signal, \"Sesame.\" When Butt saw somebody was with me, he jumped and the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out of his fingers. Then he recognized Sis from the pictures.\n \n He stepped to one side and, with the same sweeping gesture, holstered his blaster and pushed his green hood off. It was Sis's turn to jump when she saw the wild mass of hair rolling down his back.\n \n \"An honor, Miss Sparling,\" he said in that rumbly voice. \"Please come right in. There's a hurry-up draft.\"\n \n So Sis went in and I followed right after her. Mr. Brown closed the door. I tried to catch his eye so I could give him some kind of hint or explanation, but he had taken a couple of his big strides and was in the control section with Sis. She didn't give ground, though; I'll say that for her. She only came to his chest, but she had her arms crossed sternly.\n \n \"First, Mr. Brown,\" she began, like talking to a cluck of a kid in class, \"you realize that you are not only committing the political crime of traveling without a visa, and the criminal one of stowing away without paying your fare, but the moral delinquency of consuming stores intended for the personnel of this ship solely in emergency?\"\n \n \n\n \n He opened his mouth to its maximum width and raised an enormous hand. Then he let the air out and dropped his arm.\n \n \"I take it you either have no defense or care to make none,\" Sis added caustically.\n \n Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each word.\n\"Wonder if all the anura talk like that. And you want to foul up Venus.\"\n \n \"We haven't done so badly on Earth, after the mess you men made of politics. It needed a revolution of the mothers before—\"\n \n \"Needed nothing. Everyone wanted peace. Earth is a weary old world.\"\n \n \"It's a world of strong moral fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee Brown.\" Hearing his rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over her. Sis said with a certain amount of hurry and change of tone, \"What do you have to say about stowing away and using up lifeboat stores?\"\n \n \n\n \n He cocked his head and considered a moment. \"Look,\" he said finally,\n\"I have more than enough munit to pay for round trip tickets, but I couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur judge and all the charges she hung on me. Had to stow away. Picked the Eleanor Roosevelt because a couple of the boys in the crew are friends of mine and they were willing to help. But this lifeboat—don't you know that every passenger ship carries four times as many lifeboats as it needs? Not to mention the food I didn't eat because it stuck in my throat?\"\n \n \"Yes,\" she said bitterly. \"You had this boy steal fresh fruit for you. I suppose you didn't know that under space regulations that makes him equally guilty?\"\n \n \"No, Sis, he didn't,\" I was beginning to argue. \"All he wanted—\"\n \n \"Sure I knew. Also know that if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll be sent back to Earth to serve out those fancy little sentences.\"\n \n \"Well, you're guilty of them, aren't you?\"\n \n He waved his hands at her impatiently. \"I'm not talking law, female; I'm talking sense. Listen! I'm in trouble because I went to Earth to look for a wife. You're standing here right now because you're on your way to Venus for a husband. So let's.\"\n \n Sis actually staggered back. \"Let's? Let's what ? Are—are you daring to suggest that—that—\"\n \n \"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. I'm saying let's get married, and you know it. You figured out from what the boy told you that I was chewing on you for a wife. You're healthy and strong, got good heredity, you know how to operate sub-surface machinery, you've lived underwater, and your disposition's no worse than most of the anura I've seen. Prolific stock, too.\"\n \n I was so excited I just had to yell: \"Gee, Sis, say yes !\"", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "51150", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

SMITH\n \n Illustrated by DILLON\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction March 1957. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n Snaddra had but one choice in its fight to afford to live belowground—underhandedly pretend theirs was an aboveboard society!\n \n\n \n \"Go Away from me, Skkiru,\" Larhgan said, pushing his hand off her arm.\n\"A beggar does not associate with the high priestess of Snaddra.\"\n \n \"But the Earthmen aren't due for another fifteen minutes,\" Skkiru protested.\n \n \"Of what importance are fifteen minutes compared to eternity!\" she exclaimed. Her lovely eyes fuzzed softly with emotion. \"You don't seem to realize, Skkiru, that this isn't just a matter of minutes or hours. It's forever.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Forever!\" He looked at her incredulously. \"You mean we're going to keep this up as a permanent thing? You're joking!\"\n \n Bbulas groaned, but Skkiru didn't care about that. The sad, sweet way Larhgan shook her beautiful head disturbed him much more, and when she said, \"No, Skkiru, I am not joking,\" a tiny pang of doubt and apprehension began to quiver in his second smallest left toe.\n \n \"This is, in effect, good-by,\" she continued. \"We shall see each other again, of course, but only from a distance. On feast days, perhaps you may be permitted to kiss the hem of my robe ... but that will be all.\"\n \n Skkiru turned to the third person present in the council chamber.\n\"Bbulas, this is your fault! It was all your idea!\"\n \n There was regret on the Dilettante's thin face—an obviously insincere regret, the younger man knew, since he was well aware how Bbulas had always felt about the girl.\n \n \"I am sorry, Skkiru,\" Bbulas intoned. \"I had fancied you understood. This is not a game we are playing, but a new way of life we are adopting. A necessary way of life, if we of Snaddra are to keep on living at all.\"\n \n \"It's not that I don't love you, Skkiru,\" Larhgan put in gently, \"but the welfare of our planet comes first.\"\n \n \n\n \n She had been seeing too many of the Terrestrial fictapes from the library, Skkiru thought resentfully. There was too damn much Terran influence on this planet. And this new project was the last straw.\n \n No longer able to control his rage and grief, he turned a triple somersault in the air with rage. \"Then why was I made a beggar and she the high priestess? You arranged that purposely, Bbulas. You—\"\n \n \"Now, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said wearily, for they had been through all this before, \"you know that all the ranks and positions were distributed by impartial lot, except for mine, and, of course, such jobs as could carry over from the civilized into the primitive.\"\n \n Bbulas breathed on the spectacles he was wearing, as contact lenses were not considered backward enough for the kind of planet Snaddra was now supposed to be, and attempted to wipe them dry on his robe. However, the thick, jewel-studded embroidery got in his way and so he was forced to lift the robe and wipe all three of the lenses on the smooth, soft, spun metal of his top underskirt.\n \n \"After all,\" he went on speaking as he wiped, \"I have to be high priest, since I organized this culture and am the only one here qualified to administer it. And, as the president himself concurred in these arrangements, I hardly think you—a mere private citizen—have the right to question them.\"\n \n \"Just because you went to school in another solar system,\" Skkiru said, whirling with anger, \"you think you're so smart!\"\n \n \"I won't deny that I do have educational and cultural advantages which were, unfortunately, not available to the general populace of this planet. However, even under the old system, I was always glad to utilize my superior attainments as Official Dilettante for the good of all and now—\"\n \n \"Sure, glad to have a chance to rig this whole setup so you could break up things between Larhgan and me. You've had your eye on her for some time.\"\n \n Skkiru coiled his antennae at Bbulas, hoping the insult would provoke him into an unbecoming whirl, but the Dilettante remained calm. One of the chief outward signs of Terran-type training was self-control and Bbulas had been thoroughly terranized.\n  I hate Terrestrials , Skkiru said to himself. I hate Terra. The quiver of anxiety had risen up his leg and was coiling and uncoiling in his stomach. He hoped it wouldn't reach his antennae—if he were to break down and psonk in front of Larhgan, it would be the final humiliation.\n \n \"Skkiru!\" the girl exclaimed, rotating gently, for she, like her fiance—her erstwhile fiance, that was, for the new regime had caused all such ties to be severed—and every other literate person on the planet, had received her education at the local university. Although sound, the school was admittedly provincial in outlook and very poor in the emotional department. \"One would almost think that the lots had some sort of divine intelligence behind them, because you certainly are behaving in a beggarly manner!\"\n \n \"And I have already explained to you, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said, with a patience much more infuriating than the girl's anger, \"that I had no idea of who was to become my high priestess. The lots chose Larhgan. It is, as the Earthmen say, kismet.\"\n \n \n\n \n He adjusted the fall of his glittering robe before the great polished four-dimensional reflector that formed one wall of the chamber.\n  Kismet , Skkiru muttered to himself, and a little sleight of hand. But he didn't dare offer this conclusion aloud; the libel laws of Snaddra were very severe. So he had to fall back on a weak, \"And I suppose it is kismet that makes us all have to go live out on the ground during the day, like—like savages.\"\n \n \"It is necessary,\" Bbulas replied without turning.\n \n \"Pooh,\" Skkiru said. \"Pooh, pooh , POOH!\"\n \n Larhgan's dainty earflaps closed. \"Skkiru! Such language!\"\n \n \"As you said,\" Bbulas murmured, contemptuously coiling one antenna at Skkiru, \"the lots chose well and if you touch me, Skkiru, we shall have another drawing for beggar and you will be made a metal-worker.\"\n \n \"But I can't work metal!\"\n \n \"Then that will make it much worse for you than for the other outcasts,\" Bbulas said smugly, \"because you will be a pariah without a trade.\"\n \n \"Speaking of pariahs, that reminds me, Skkiru, before I forget, I'd better give you back your grimpatch—\" Larhgan handed the glittering bauble to him—\"and you give me mine. Since we can't be betrothed any longer, you might want to give yours to some nice beggar girl.\"\n \n \"I don't want to give my grimpatch to some nice beggar girl!\" Skkiru yelled, twirling madly in the air.\n \n \"As for me,\" she sighed, standing soulfully on her head, \"I do not think I shall ever marry. I shall make the religious life my career. Are there going to be any saints in your mythos, Bbulas?\"\n \n \"Even if there will be,\" Bbulas said, \"you certainly won't qualify if you keep putting yourself into a position which not only represents a trait wholly out of keeping with the new culture, but is most unseemly with the high priestess's robes.\"\n \n Larhgan ignored his unfeeling observations. \"I shall set myself apart from mundane affairs,\" she vowed, \"and I shall pretend to be happy, even though my heart will be breaking.\"\n \n It was only at that moment that Skkiru realized just how outrageous the whole thing really was. There must be another solution to the planet's problem. \"Listen—\" he began, but just then excited noises filtered down from overhead. It was too late.\n \n \"Earth ship in view!\" a squeaky voice called through the intercom.\n\"Everybody topside and don't forget your shoes.\"\n \n Except the beggar. Beggars went barefoot. Beggars suffered. Bbulas had made him beggar purposely, and the lots were a lot of slibwash.\n \n \"Hurry up, Skkiru.\"\n \n \n\n \n Bbulas slid the ornate headdress over his antennae, which, already gilded and jeweled, at once seemed to become a part of it. He looked pretty damn silly, Skkiru thought, at the same time conscious of his own appearance—which was, although picturesque enough to delight romantic Terrestrial hearts, sufficiently wretched to charm the most hardened sadist.\n \n \"Hurry up, Skkiru,\" Bbulas said. \"They mustn't suspect the existence of the city underground or we're finished before we've started.\"\n \n \"For my part, I wish we'd never started,\" Skkiru grumbled. \"What was wrong with our old culture, anyway?\"\n \n That was intended as a rhetorical question, but Bbulas answered it anyway. He always answered questions; it had never seemed to penetrate his mind that school-days were long since over.\n \n \"I've told you a thousand times that our old culture was too much like the Terrans' own to be of interest to them,\" he said, with affected weariness. \"After all, most civilized societies are basically similar; it is only primitive societies that differ sharply, one from the other—and we have to be different to attract Earthmen. They're pretty choosy. You've got to give them what they want, and that's what they want. Now take up your post on the edge of the field, try to look hungry, and remember this isn't for you or for me, but for Snaddra.\"\n \n \"For Snaddra,\" Larhgan said, placing her hand over her anterior heart in a gesture which, though devout on Earth—or so the fictapes seemed to indicate—was obscene on Snaddra, owing to the fact that certain essential organs were located in different areas in the Snaddrath than in the corresponding Terrestrial life-form. Already the Terrestrial influence was corrupting her, Skkiru thought mournfully. She had been such a nice girl, too.\n \n \"We may never meet on equal terms again, Skkiru,\" she told him, with a long, soulful glance that made his hearts sink down to his quivering toes, \"but I promise you there will never be anyone else for me—and I hope that knowledge will inspire you to complete cooperation with Bbulas.\"\n \n \"If that doesn't,\" Bbulas said, \"I have other methods of inspiration.\"\n \n \"All right,\" Skkiru answered sulkily. \"I'll go to the edge of the field, and I'll speak broken Inter-galactic, and I'll forsake my normal habits and customs, and I'll even beg . But I don't have to like doing it, and I don't intend to like doing it.\"\n \n All three of Larhgan's eyes fuzzed with emotion. \"I'm proud of you, Skkiru,\" she said brokenly.\n \n Bbulas sniffed. The three of them floated up to ground level in a triple silence.\n \n \n\n \n \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" Skkiru chanted, as the two Terrans descended from the ship and plowed their way through the mud to meet a procession of young Snaddrath dressed in elaborate ceremonial costumes, and singing a popular ballad—to which less ribald, as well as less inspiring, words than the originals had been fitted by Bbulas, just in case, by some extremely remote chance, the Terrans had acquired a smattering of Snadd somewhere. Since neither party was accustomed to navigating mud, their progress was almost imperceptible.\n \n \"Alms, for the love of Ipsnadd,\" chanted Skkiru the beggar. His teeth chattered as he spoke, for the rags he wore had been custom-weatherbeaten for him by the planet's best tailor—now a pariah, of course, because Snadd tailors were, naturally, metal-workers—and the wind and the rain were joyously making their way through the demolished wires. Never before had Skkiru been on the surface of the planet, except to pass over, and he had actually touched it only when taking off and landing. The Snaddrath had no means of land transport, having previously found it unnecessary—but now both air-cars and self-levitation were on the prohibited list as being insufficiently primitive.\n \n The outside was no place for a civilized human being, particularly in the wet season or—more properly speaking on Snaddra—the wetter season. Skkiru's feet were soaked with mud; not that the light sandals worn by the members of the procession appeared to be doing them much good, either. It gave him a kind of melancholy pleasure to see that the privileged ones were likewise trying to repress shivers. Though their costumes were rich, they were also scanty, particularly in the case of the females, for Earthmen had been reported by tape and tale to be humanoid.\n \n As the mud clutched his toes, Skkiru remembered an idea he had once gotten from an old sporting fictape of Terrestrial origin and had always planned to experiment with, but had never gotten around to—the weather had always been so weathery, there were so many other more comfortable sports, Larhgan had wanted him to spend more of his leisure hours with her, and so on. However, he still had the equipment, which he'd salvaged from a wrecked air-car, in his apartment—and it was the matter of a moment to run down, while Bbulas was looking the other way, and get it.\n \n Bbulas couldn't really object, Skkiru stilled the nagging quiver in his toe, because what could be more primitive than any form of land transport? And even though it took time to get the things, they worked so well that, in spite of the procession's head start, he was at the Earth ship long before the official greeters had reached it.\n \n \n\n \n The newcomers were indeed humanoid, he saw. Only the peculiarly pasty color of their skins and their embarrassing lack of antennae distinguished them visibly from the Snaddrath. They were dressed much as the Snaddrath had been before they had adopted primitive garb.\n \n In fact, the Terrestrials were quite decent-looking life-forms, entirely different from the foppish monsters Skkiru had somehow expected to represent the cultural ruling race. Of course, he had frequently seen pictures of them, but everyone knew how easily those could be retouched. Why, it was the Terrestrials themselves, he had always understood, who had invented the art of retouching—thus proving beyond a doubt that they had something to hide.\n \n \"Look, Raoul,\" the older of the two Earthmen said in Terran—which the Snaddrath were not, according to the master plan, supposed to understand, but which most of them did, for it was the fashionable third language on most of the outer planets. \"A beggar. Haven't seen one since some other chaps and I were doing a spot of field work on that little planet in the Arcturus system—what was its name? Glotch, that's it. Very short study, it turned out to be. Couldn't get more than a pamphlet out of it, as we were unable to stay long enough to amass enough material for a really definitive work. The natives tried to eat us, so we had to leave in somewhat of a hurry.\"\n \n \"Oh, they were cannibals?\" the other Earthman asked, so respectfully that it was easy to deduce he was the subordinate of the two. \"How horrible!\"\n \n \"No, not at all,\" the other assured him. \"They weren't human—another species entirely—so you could hardly call it cannibalism. In fact, it was quite all right from the ethical standpoint, but abstract moral considerations seemed less important to us than self-preservation just then. Decided that, in this case, it would be best to let the missionaries get first crack at them. Soften them up, you know.\"\n \n \"And the missionaries—did they soften them up, Cyril?\"\n \n \"They softened up the missionaries, I believe.\" Cyril laughed. \"Ah, well, it's all in the day's work.\"\n \n \"I hope these creatures are not man-eaters,\" Raoul commented, with a polite smile at Cyril and an apprehensive glance at the oncoming procession— creatures indeed ! Skkiru thought, with a mental sniff.\n\"We have come such a long and expensive way to study them that it would be indeed a pity if we also were forced to depart in haste. Especially since this is my first field trip and I would like to make good at it.\"\n \n \"Oh, you will, my boy, you will.\" Cyril clapped the younger man on the shoulder. \"I have every confidence in your ability.\"\n \n Either he was stupid, Skkiru thought, or he was lying, in spite of Bbulas' asseverations that untruth was unknown to Terrestrials—which had always seemed highly improbable, anyway. How could any intelligent life-form possibly stick to the truth all the time? It wasn't human; it wasn't even humanoid; it wasn't even polite.\n \n \"The natives certainly appear to be human enough,\" Raoul added, with an appreciative glance at the females, who had been selected for the processional honor with a view to reported Terrestrial tastes. \"Some slight differences, of course—but, if two eyes are beautiful, three eyes can be fifty per cent lovelier, and chartreuse has always been my favorite color.\"\n  If they stand out here in the cold much longer, they are going to turn bright yellow. His own skin, Skkiru knew, had faded from its normal healthy emerald to a sickly celadon.\n \n \n\n \n Cyril frowned and his companion's smile vanished, as if the contortion of his superior's face had activated a circuit somewhere. Maybe the little one's a robot! However, it couldn't be—a robot would be better constructed and less interested in females than Raoul.\n \n \"Remember,\" Cyril said sternly, \"we must not establish undue rapport with the native females. It tends to detract from true objectivity.\"\n \n \"Yes, Cyril,\" Raoul said meekly.\n \n Cyril assumed a more cheerful aspect \"I should like to give this chap something for old times' sake. What do you suppose is the medium of exchange here?\"\n  Money , Skkiru said to himself, but he didn't dare contribute this piece of information, helpful though it would be.\n \n \"How should I know?\" Raoul shrugged.\n \n \"Empathize. Get in there, old chap, and start batting.\"\n \n \"Why not give him a bar of chocolate, then?\" Raoul suggested grumpily.\n\"The language of the stomach, like the language of love, is said to be a universal one.\"\n \n \"Splendid idea! I always knew you had it in you, Raoul!\"\n \n Skkiru accepted the candy with suitable—and entirely genuine—murmurs of gratitude. Chocolate was found only in the most expensive of the planet's delicacy shops—and now neither delicacy shops nor chocolate were to be found, so, if Bbulas thought he was going to save the gift to contribute it later to the Treasury, the \"high priest\" was off his rocker.\n \n To make sure there would be no subsequent dispute about possession, Skkiru ate the candy then and there. Chocolate increased the body's resistance to weather, and never before had he had to endure so much weather all at once.\n \n On Earth, he had heard, where people lived exposed to weather, they often sickened of it and passed on—which helped to solve the problem of birth control on so vulgarly fecund a planet. Snaddra, alas, needed no such measures, for its population—like its natural resources—was dwindling rapidly. Still, Skkiru thought, as he moodily munched on the chocolate, it would have been better to flicker out on their own than to descend to a subterfuge like this for nothing more than survival.\n \n \n\n \n Being a beggar, Skkiru discovered, did give him certain small, momentary advantages over those who had been alloted higher ranks. For one thing, it was quite in character for him to tread curiously upon the strangers' heels all the way to the temple—a ramshackle affair, but then it had been run up in only three days—where the official reception was to be held. The principal difficulty was that, because of his equipment, he had a little trouble keeping himself from overshooting the strangers. And though Bbulas might frown menacingly at him—and not only for his forwardness—that was in character on both sides, too.\n \n Nonetheless, Skkiru could not reconcile himself to his beggarhood, no matter how much he tried to comfort himself by thinking at least he wasn't a pariah like the unfortunate metal-workers who had to stand segregated from the rest by a chain of their own devising—a poetic thought, that was, but well in keeping with his beggarhood. Beggars were often poets, he believed, and poets almost always beggars. Since metal-working was the chief industry of Snaddra, this had provided the planet automatically with a large lowest caste. Bbulas had taken the easy way out.\n \n Skkiru swallowed the last of the chocolate and regarded the \"high priest\" with a simple-minded mendicant's grin. However, there were volcanic passions within him that surged up from his toes when, as the wind and rain whipped through his scanty coverings, he remembered the snug underskirts Bbulas was wearing beneath his warm gown. They were metal, but they were solid. All the garments visible or potentially visible were of woven metal, because, although there was cloth on the planet, it was not politic for the Earthmen to discover how heavily the Snaddrath depended upon imports.\n \n As the Earthmen reached the temple, Larhgan now appeared to join Bbulas at the head of the long flight of stairs that led to it. Although Skkiru had seen her in her priestly apparel before, it had not made the emotional impression upon him then that it did now, when, standing there, clad in beauty, dignity and warm clothes, she bade the newcomers welcome in several thousand words not too well chosen for her by Bbulas—who fancied himself a speech-writer as well as a speech-maker, for there was no end to the man's conceit.\n \n The difference between her magnificent garments and his own miserable rags had their full impact upon Skkiru at this moment. He saw the gulf that had been dug between them and, for the first time in his short life, he felt the tormenting pangs of caste distinction. She looked so lovely and so remote.\n \n \"... and so you are most welcome to Snaddra, men of Earth,\" she was saying in her melodious voice. \"Our resources may be small but our hearts are large, and what little we have, we offer with humility and with love. We hope that you will enjoy as long and as happy a stay here as you did on Nemeth....\"\n \n Cyril looked at Raoul, who, however, seemed too absorbed in contemplating Larhgan's apparently universal charms to pay much attention to the expression on his companion's face.\n \n \"... and that you will carry our affection back to all the peoples of the Galaxy.\"\n \n \n\n \n She had finished. And now Cyril cleared his throat. \"Dear friends, we were honored by your gracious invitation to visit this fair planet, and we are honored now by the cordial reception you have given to us.\"\n \n The crowd yoomped politely. After a slight start, Cyril went on, apparently deciding that applause was all that had been intended.\n \n \"We feel quite sure that we are going to derive both pleasure and profit from our stay here, and we promise to make our intensive analysis of your culture as painless as possible. We wish only to study your society, not to tamper with it in any way.\"\n  Ha, ha , Skkiru said to himself. Ha, ha, ha!\n \n \n \"But why is it,\" Raoul whispered in Terran as he glanced around out of the corners of his eyes, \"that only the beggar wears mudshoes?\"\n \n \"Shhh,\" Cyril hissed back. \"We'll find out later, when we've established rapport. Don't be so impatient!\"\n \n Bbulas gave a sickly smile. Skkiru could almost find it in his hearts to feel sorry for the man.\n \n \"We have prepared our best hut for you, noble sirs,\" Bbulas said with great self-control, \"and, by happy chance, this very evening a small but unusually interesting ceremony will be held outside the temple. We hope you will be able to attend. It is to be a rain dance.\"\n \n \"Rain dance!\" Raoul pulled his macintosh together more tightly at the throat. \"But why do you want rain? My faith, not only does it rain now, but the planet seems to be a veritable sea of mud. Not, of course,\" he added hurriedly as Cyril's reproachful eye caught his, \"that it is not attractive mud. Finest mud I have ever seen. Such texture, such color, such aroma!\"\n \n Cyril nodded three times and gave an appreciative sniff.\n \n \"But,\" Raoul went on, \"one can have too much of even such a good thing as mud....\"\n \n The smile did not leave Bbulas' smooth face. \"Yes, of course, honorable Terrestrials. That is why we are holding this ceremony. It is not a dance to bring on rain. It is a dance to stop rain.\"\n \n He was pretty quick on the uptake, Skkiru had to concede. However, that was not enough. The man had no genuine organizational ability. In the time he'd had in which to plan and carry out a scheme for the improvement of Snaddra, surely he could have done better than this high-school theocracy. For one thing, he could have apportioned the various roles so that each person would be making a definite contribution to the society, instead of creating some positions plums, like the priesthood, and others prunes, like the beggarship.\n \n What kind of life was that for an active, ambitious young man, standing around begging? And, moreover, from whom was Skkiru going to beg? Only the Earthmen, for the Snaddrath, no matter how much they threw themselves into the spirit of their roles, could not be so carried away that they would give handouts to a young man whom they had been accustomed to see basking in the bosom of luxury.\n \n \n\n \n Unfortunately, the fees that he'd received in the past had not enabled him both to live well and to save, and now that his fortunes had been so drastically reduced, he seemed in a fair way of starving to death. It gave him a gentle, moody pleasure to envisage his own funeral, although, at the same time, he realized that Bbulas would probably have to arrange some sort of pension for him; he could not expect Skkiru's patriotism to extend to abnormal limits. A man might be willing to die for his planet in many ways—but wantonly starving to death as the result of a primitive affectation was hardly one of them.\n \n All the same, Skkiru reflected as he watched the visitors being led off to the native hut prepared for them, how ignominious it would be for one of the brightest young architects on the planet to have to subsist miserably on the dole just because the world had gone aboveground. The capital had risen to the surface and the other cities would soon follow suit. Meanwhile, a careful system of tabus had been designed to keep the Earthmen from discovering the existence of those other cities.\n \n He could, of course, emigrate to another part of the planet, to one of them, and stave off his doom for a while—but that would not be playing the game. Besides, in such a case, he wouldn't be able to see Larhgan.\n \n As if all this weren't bad enough, he had been done an injury which struck directly at his professional pride. He hadn't even been allowed to help in planning the huts. Bbulas and some workmen had done all that themselves with the aid of some antique blueprints that had been put out centuries before by a Terrestrial magazine and had been acquired from a rare tape-and-book dealer on Gambrell, for, Skkiru thought, far too high a price. He could have designed them himself just as badly and much more cheaply.\n \n It wasn't that Skkiru didn't understand well enough that Snaddra had been forced into making such a drastic change in its way of life. What resources it once possessed had been depleted and—aside from minerals—they had never been very extensive to begin with. All life-forms on the planet were on the point of extinction, save fish and rice—the only vegetable that would grow on Snaddra, and originally a Terran import at that. So food and fiber had to be brought from the other planets, at fabulous expense, for Snaddra was not on any of the direct trade routes and was too unattractive to lure the tourist business.\n \n Something definitely had to be done, if it were not to decay altogether. And that was where the Planetary Dilettante came in.\n \n \n\n \n The traditional office of Planetary Dilettante was a civil-service job, awarded by competitive examination whenever it fell vacant to the person who scored highest in intelligence, character and general gloonatz. However, the tests were inadequate when it came to measuring sense of proportion, adaptiveness and charm—and there, Skkiru felt, was where the essential flaw lay. After all, no really effective test would have let a person like Bbulas come out on top.\n \n The winner was sent to Gambrell, the nearest planet with a Terran League University, to be given a thorough Terran-type education. No individual on Snaddra could afford such schooling, no matter how great his personal fortune, because the transportation costs were so immense that only a government could afford them. That was the reason why only one person in each generation could be chosen to go abroad at the planet's expense and acquire enough finish to cover the rest of the population.\n \n The Dilettante's official function had always been, in theory, to serve the planet when an emergency came—and this, old Luccar, the former President, had decided, when he and the Parliament had awakened to the fact that Snaddra was falling into ruin, was an emergency. So he had, after considerable soul-searching, called upon Bbulas to plan a method of saving Snaddra—and Bbulas, happy to be in the limelight at last, had come up with this program.\n \n It was not one Skkiru himself would have chosen. It was not one, he felt, that any reasonable person would have chosen. Nevertheless, the Bbulas Plan had been adopted by a majority vote of the Snaddrath, largely because no one had come up with a feasible alternative and, as a patriotic citizen, Skkiru would abide by it. He would accept the status of beggar; it was his duty to do so. Moreover, as in the case of the planet, there was no choice.\n \n But all was not necessarily lost, he told himself. Had he not, in his anthropological viewings—though Bbulas might have been the only one privileged to go on ethnological field trips to other planets, he was not the only one who could use a library—seen accounts of societies where beggarhood could be a rewarding and even responsible station in life? There was no reason why, within the framework of the primitive society Bbulas had created to allure Terran anthropologists, Skkiru should not make something of himself and show that a beggar was worthy of the high priestess's hand—which would be entirely in the Terran primitive tradition of romance.\n \n \"Skkiru!\" Bbulas was screaming, as he spun, now that the Terrans were out of ear- and eye-shot \"Skkiru, you idiot, listen to me! What are those ridiculous things you are wearing on your silly feet?\"\n \n Skkiru protruded all of his eyes in innocent surprise. \"Just some old pontoons I took from a wrecked air-car once. I have a habit of collecting junk and I thought—\"\n \n Bbulas twirled madly in the air. \"You are not supposed to think. Leave all the thinking to me!\"\n \n \"Yes, Bbulas,\" Skkiru said meekly.", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "51413", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

HALEY\n \n There's a place for every man and a man for every place, but on robot-harried Mars the situation was just a little different.\n \n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1955. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner from jumping.\n \n \"Just lie back, Harp,\" droned his sister soothingly. \"Just give in and let go of everything.\"\n \n Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.\n \n For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously stationary sofa.\n \n \"Harp!\" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. \"Dr. Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a trial?\"\n \n Harper glared at the preposterous chair. \"Franz!\" he snarled. \"That prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!\" Completely outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.\n \n \"Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.\"\n \n Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.\n\"Vacation!\" he snorted. \"Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible, reasonable coöperation from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the—\"\n \n \"Hey, Harp, old man!\" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.\n\"Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk twenty years ago?\"\n \n Harper's hands twitched violently. \"Don't mention that fiasco!\" he rasped. \"That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!\"\n \n \n\n \n Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere with the harmony of his home.\n \n \"You're away behind the times, Harp,\" he declared. \"Don't you know that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man, you missed a bet!\"\n \n Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes, other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the drawing looked lovely and enticing.\n \n \"Why, I remember now!\" exclaimed Bella. \"That's where the Durants went two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?\"\n \n Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian springs had effected in the Durants. \"It's the very thing for you, Harp,\" he advised. \"You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not only that.\" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking brother-in-law. \"The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns to process the stuff!\"\n \n Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and calculating. He even forgot to twitch. \"Maybe you're right, Scrib,\" he acknowledged. \"Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?\"\n \n Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that was when he saw the line about the robots. \"—the only hotel staffed entirely with robot servants—\"\n \n \"Robots!\" he shrilled. \"You mean they've developed the things to that point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll disfranchise him! I'll—\"\n \n \"Harp!\" exploded Bella. \"Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel, why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a tantrum? That's the only sensible way!\"\n \n \"You're right, Bella,\" agreed Harper incisively. \"I'll go and find out for myself. Immediately!\" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual lope.\n \n \"Well!\" remarked his sister. \"All I can say is that they'd better turn that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!\"\n \n \n\n \n The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the interval.\n \n It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.\n \n Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting, green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.\n \n He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt, he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.\n \n Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly he went over to the desk.\n \n He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself. Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the stress of the argument.\n \n \"A nurse!\" shouted the woman. \"I want a nurse! A real woman! For what you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you hear?\"\n \n No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing. The clerk flinched visibly. \"Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,\" he soothed. \"You know the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive, really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know. Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?\" Toothily he smiled at the enraged woman.\n \n \"That's just it!\" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. \"The service is too good. I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once in awhile!\"\n \n Harper snorted. \"Wants someone she can devil,\" he diagnosed. \"Someone she can get a kick out of ordering around.\" With vast contempt he stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.\n \n \"One moment, sir,\" begged that harassed individual. \"Just one moment, please.\" He turned back to the woman.\n \n But she had turned her glare on Harper. \"You could at least be civil enough to wait your turn!\"\n \n Harper smirked. \"My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course, are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a normal human trait.\" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned authoritatively to the clerk.\n \n \"I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing your—ah—discussion with the lady.\"\n \n The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.\n \n \"This is a helluva joint!\" roared the voice. \"Man could rot away to the knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!\" Again his fist banged the counter.\n \n The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it. Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.\n \n \"Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.\" With a pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a silent and efficient robot.\n \n \n\n \n The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men; mere details....\n \n Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule. Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim cigar—his first in months—and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.\n \n Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him out.\n \n Harper's tongue finally functioned. \"What's all this?\" he demanded.\n\"There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!\"\n \n He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest. Inexorably it pushed him flat.\n \n \"You've got the wrong room!\" yelled Harp. \"Let me go!\" But the hypo began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something, at that.\n \n \n\n \n There was a tentative knock on the door. \"Come in,\" called Harper bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.\n \n \"Say, pardner,\" he said hoarsely, \"you haven't seen any of them robots around here, have you?\"\n \n Harper scowled. \"Oh, haven't I?\" he grated. \"Robots! Do you know what they did to me.\" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. \"Came in here while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The only meal I've enjoyed in months!\" Blackly he sank his chin onto his fist and contemplated the outrage.\n \n \"Why didn't you stop 'em?\" reasonably asked the visitor.\n \n \"Stop a robot?\" Harper glared pityingly. \"How? You can't reason with the blasted things. And as for using force—it's man against metal. You try it!\" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. \"And to think I had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready to staff my offices with the things!\"\n \n The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and groaned. \"I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.\"\n \n \"Tundra?\" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. \"You mean you work out here on the tundra?\"\n \n \"That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts. Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it, he's about out of business.\"\n \n Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak. But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third robot enter, wheeling a chair.\n \n \"A wheel chair!\" squeaked the victim. \"I tell you, there's nothing wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me! Take it away!\"\n \n The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.\n \n The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, \"Take me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers—\"\n \n Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped him down and marched out with him.\n \n \n\n \n Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly, mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed.\n \n \n\n \n There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do. Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it out.\n \n For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often, since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and exercised him.\n \n Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept. There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.\n \n \"Persecution, that's what it is!\" he moaned desperately. And he turned his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he could wake up enough to be.\n \n He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again, still moaning about his lack of treatments. \"Nothin' yet,\" he gloomily informed Harp. \"They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it. After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a man or he's stuck.\"\n \n \"Stuck!\" snarled Harp. \"I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait any longer to break out of this—this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what happens?\"\n \n \"Say, maybe you're right!\" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. \"I'll get my clothes.\"\n \n Harp's eyebrows rose. \"You mean they left you your clothes?\"\n \n \"Why, sure. You mean they took yours?\"\n \n Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. \"Leave your things, will you? I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.\"\n \n Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. \"Maybe you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in that fancy lobby.\"\n \n Harper looked at his watch. \"Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.\"\n \n Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's clothing.\n \n The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.\n\"This is room 618,\" he said authoritatively. \"Send up the elevator for me. I want to go down to the lobby.\"\n \n He'd guessed right again. \"It will be right up, sir,\" responded the robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to the elevator.\n \n \n\n \n Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge suave lobby.\n \n He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots shared his self control.\n \n The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor. Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard. With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. \"Get that patient!\" he ordered. \"Take him to the—to the mud-baths!\"\n \n \"No you don't!\" yelled Harper. \"I want to see the manager!\" Nimbly he circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes. Especially, card indexes.\n \n \"Stop it!\" begged the clerk. \"You'll wreck the system! We'll never get it straight again! Stop it!\"\n \n \"Call them off!\" snarled Harper. \"Call them off or I'll ruin your switchboard!\" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.\n \n With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became oddly inanimate.\n \n \"That's better!\" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the collar of his flapping coat. \"Now—the manager, please.\"\n \n \"This—this way, sir.\" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.\n \n Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. \"My good man—\" he began.\n \n \"Don't 'my-good-man' me!\" snapped Harper. He glared back at the manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could stretch, he shook his puny fist. \"Do you know who I am? I'm Harper S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why? Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me, Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!\"\n \n Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair. With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. \" My robots!\" he muttered.\n\"As if I invented the damned things!\"\n \n Despondently he looked at Harper. \"Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway, at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my resignation.\"\n \n Again he sighed. \"The trouble,\" he explained, \"is that those fool robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way. We—\" he grimaced disgustedly—\"had to pioneer in the use of robots. And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help. So—Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.\"\n \n Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. \"Oh, I don't know,\" he said mildly.\n \n Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. \"What do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts, aren't you?\"\n \n Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. \"It seems to me that these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands—at a reasonable price, of course—and forget the outrages I've suffered at your establishment.\"\n \n Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. \"You mean you want these robots after what you've seen and experienced?\"\n \n Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. \"Of course, you'd have to take into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.\"\n \n With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his head. \"My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr. Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of the hotel.\" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but across the lobby to the elevator.\n \n Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready for the second step of his private Operation Robot.\n \n \n\n \n Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day—the kind of day unknown to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits, waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered from deceleration.\n \n \"Look, Scrib!\" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. \"It's finally opening.\"\n \n They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.\n \n \"There he is!\" cried Bella. \"Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib, it's amazing! Look at him!\n \n And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.\n \n \"Well, you old dog!\" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. \"So you did it again!\"\n \n Harper smirked. \"Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to you. All right?\"\n \n \"All right?\" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human after all. \"All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?\"\n \n Harper's smile vanished. \"Don't even mention such a thing!\" he yelped.\n\"You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they belong!\"\n \n He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary, waiting patiently in the background. \"Oh there you are, Smythe.\" He turned to his relatives. \"Busy day ahead. See you later, folks—\"\n \n \"Same old Harp,\" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of stock. \"What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate, honey?\"\n \n \"Wonderful!\" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left the port.", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "63616", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n \"I'm not at all sure,\" Under-Secretary Sternwheeler said, \"that I fully understand the necessity for your ... ah ... absenting yourself from your post of duty, Mr. Retief. Surely this matter could have been dealt with in the usual way—assuming any action is necessary.\"\n \n \"I had a sharp attack of writer's cramp, Mr. Secretary,\" Retief said.\n\"So I thought I'd better come along in person—just to be sure I was positive of making my point.\"\n \n \"Eh?\"\n \n \"Why, ah, there were a number of dispatches,\" Deputy Under-Secretary Magnan put in. \"Unfortunately, this being end-of-the-fiscal-year time, we found ourselves quite inundated with reports. Reports, reports, reports—\"\n \n \"Not criticizing the reporting system, are you, Mr. Magnan?\" the Under-Secretary barked.\n \n \"Gracious, no,\" Magnan said. \"I love reports.\"\n \n \"It seems nobody's told the Aga Kagans about fiscal years,\" Retief said. \"They're going right ahead with their program of land-grabbing on Flamme. So far, I've persuaded the Boyars that this is a matter for the Corps, and not to take matters into their own hands.\"\n \n The Under-Secretary nodded. \"Quite right. Carry on along the same lines. Now, if there's nothing further—\"\n \n \"Thank you, Mr. Secretary,\" Magnan said, rising. \"We certainly appreciate your guidance.\"\n \n \"There is a little something further,\" said Retief, sitting solidly in his chair. \"What's the Corps going to do about the Aga Kagans?\"\n \n The Under-Secretary turned a liverish eye on Retief. \"As Minister to Flamme, you should know that the function of a diplomatic representative is merely to ... what shall I say...?\"\n \n \"String them along?\" Magnan suggested.\n \n \"An unfortunate choice of phrase,\" the Under-Secretary said. \"However, it embodies certain realities of Galactic politics. The Corps must concern itself with matters of broad policy.\"\n \n \"Sixty years ago the Corps was encouraging the Boyars to settle Flamme,\" Retief said. \"They were assured of Corps support.\"\n \n \"I don't believe you'll find that in writing,\" said the Under-Secretary blandly. \"In any event, that was sixty years ago. At that time a foothold against Neo-Concordiatist elements was deemed desirable. Now the situation has changed.\"\n \n \"The Boyars have spent sixty years terraforming Flamme,\" Retief said.\n\"They've cleared jungle, descummed the seas, irrigated deserts, set out forests. They've just about reached the point where they can begin to enjoy it. The Aga Kagans have picked this as a good time to move in. They've landed thirty detachments of 'fishermen'—complete with armored trawlers mounting 40 mm infinite repeaters—and another two dozen parties of 'homesteaders'—all male and toting rocket launchers.\"\n \n \"Surely there's land enough on the world to afford space to both groups,\" the Under-Secretary said. \"A spirit of co-operation—\"\n \n \n\n \n \"The Boyars needed some co-operation sixty years ago,\" Retief said.\n\"They tried to get the Aga Kagans to join in and help them beat back some of the saurian wild life that liked to graze on people. The Corps didn't like the idea. They wanted to see an undisputed anti-Concordiatist enclave. The Aga Kagans didn't want to play, either. But now that the world is tamed, they're moving in.\"\n \n \"The exigencies of diplomacy require a flexible policy—\"\n \n \"I want a firm assurance of Corps support to take back to Flamme,\" Retief said. \"The Boyars are a little naive. They don't understand diplomatic triple-speak. They just want to hold onto the homes they've made out of a wasteland.\"\n \n \"I'm warning you, Retief!\" the Under-Secretary snapped, leaning forward, wattles quivering. \"Corps policy with regard to Flamme includes no inflammatory actions based on outmoded concepts. The Boyars will have to accommodate themselves to the situation!\"\n \n \"That's what I'm afraid of,\" Retief said. \"They're not going to sit still and watch it happen. If I don't take back concrete evidence of Corps backing, we're going to have a nice hot little shooting war on our hands.\"\n \n The Under-Secretary pushed out his lips and drummed his fingers on the desk.\n \n \"Confounded hot-heads,\" he muttered. \"Very well, Retief. I'll go along to the extent of a Note; but positively no further.\"\n \n \"A Note? I was thinking of something more like a squadron of Corps Peace Enforcers running through a few routine maneuvers off Flamme.\"\n \n \"Out of the question. A stiffly worded Protest Note is the best I can do. That's final.\"\n \n Back in the corridor, Magnan turned to Retief. \"When will you learn not to argue with Under-Secretaries? One would think you actively disliked the idea of ever receiving a promotion. I was astonished at the Under-Secretary's restraint. Frankly, I was stunned when he actually agreed to a Note. I, of course, will have to draft it.\" Magnan pulled at his lower lip thoughtfully. \"Now, I wonder, should I view with deep concern an act of open aggression, or merely point out an apparent violation of technicalities....\"\n \n \"Don't bother,\" Retief said. \"I have a draft all ready to go.\"\n \n \"But how—?\"\n \n \"I had a feeling I'd get paper instead of action,\" Retief said. \"I thought I'd save a little time all around.\"\n \n \"At times, your cynicism borders on impudence.\"\n \n \"At other times, it borders on disgust. Now, if you'll run the Note through for signature, I'll try to catch the six o'clock shuttle.\"\n \n \"Leaving so soon? There's an important reception tonight. Some of our biggest names will be there. An excellent opportunity for you to join in the diplomatic give-and-take.\"\n \n \"No, thanks. I want to get back to Flamme and join in something mild, like a dinosaur hunt.\"\n \n \"When you get there,\" said Magnan, \"I hope you'll make it quite clear that this matter is to be settled without violence.\"\n \n \"Don't worry. I'll keep the peace, if I have to start a war to do it.\"\n \n \n\n \n On the broad verandah at Government House, Retief settled himself comfortably in a lounge chair. He accepted a tall glass from a white-jacketed waiter and regarded the flamboyant Flamme sunset, a gorgeous blaze of vermillion and purple that reflected from a still lake, tinged the broad lawn with color, silhouetted tall poplars among flower beds.\n \n \"You've done great things here in sixty years, Georges,\" said Retief.\n\"Not that natural geological processes wouldn't have produced the same results, given a couple of hundred million years.\"\n \n \"Don't belabor the point,\" the Boyar Chef d'Regime said. \"Since we seem to be on the verge of losing it.\"\n \n \"You're forgetting the Note.\"\n \n \"A Note,\" Georges said, waving his cigar. \"What the purple polluted hell is a Note supposed to do? I've got Aga Kagan claim-jumpers camped in the middle of what used to be a fine stand of barley, cooking sheep's brains over dung fires not ten miles from Government House—and upwind at that.\"\n \n \"Say, if that's the same barley you distill your whiskey from, I'd call that a first-class atrocity.\"\n \n \"Retief, on your say-so, I've kept my boys on a short leash. They've put up with plenty. Last week, while you were away, these barbarians sailed that flotilla of armor-plated junks right through the middle of one of our best oyster breeding beds. It was all I could do to keep a bunch of our men from going out in private helis and blasting 'em out of the water.\"\n \n \"That wouldn't have been good for the oysters, either.\"\n \n \"That's what I told 'em. I also said you'd be back here in a few days with something from Corps HQ. When I tell 'em all we've got is a piece of paper, that'll be the end. There's a strong vigilante organization here that's been outfitting for the last four weeks. If I hadn't held them back with assurances that the CDT would step in and take care of this invasion, they would have hit them before now.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"That would have been a mistake,\" said Retief. \"The Aga Kagans are tough customers. They're active on half a dozen worlds at the moment. They've been building up for this push for the last five years. A show of resistance by you Boyars without Corps backing would be an invitation to slaughter—with the excuse that you started it.\"\n \n \"So what are we going to do? Sit here and watch these goat-herders take over our farms and fisheries?\"\n \n \"Those goat-herders aren't all they seem. They've got a first-class modern navy.\"\n \n \"I've seen 'em. They camp in goat-skin tents, gallop around on animal-back, wear dresses down to their ankles—\"\n \n \"The 'goat-skin' tents are a high-polymer plastic, made in the same factory that turns out those long flowing bullet-proof robes you mention. The animals are just for show. Back home they use helis and ground cars of the most modern design.\"\n \n The Chef d'Regime chewed his cigar.\n \n \"Why the masquerade?\"\n \n \"Something to do with internal policies, I suppose.\"\n \n \"So we sit tight and watch 'em take our world away from us. That's what I get for playing along with you, Retief. We should have clobbered these monkeys as soon as they set foot on our world.\"\n \n \"Slow down, I haven't finished yet. There's still the Note.\"\n \n \"I've got plenty of paper already. Rolls and rolls of it.\"\n \n \"Give diplomatic processes a chance,\" said Retief. \"The Note hasn't even been delivered yet. Who knows? We may get surprising results.\"\n \n \"If you expect me to supply a runner for the purpose, you're out of luck. From what I hear, he's likely to come back with his ears stuffed in his hip pocket.\"\n \n \"I'll deliver the Note personally,\" Retief said. \"I could use a couple of escorts—preferably strong-arm lads.\"\n \n The Chef d'Regime frowned, blew out a cloud of smoke. \"I wasn't kidding about these Aga Kagans,\" he said. \"I hear they have some nasty habits. I don't want to see you operated on with the same knives they use to skin out the goats.\"\n \n \"I'd be against that myself. Still, the mail must go through.\"\n \n \"Strong-arm lads, eh? What have you got in mind, Retief?\"\n \n \"A little muscle in the background is an old diplomatic custom,\" Retief said.\n \n The Chef d'Regime stubbed out his cigar thoughtfully. \"I used to be a pretty fair elbow-wrestler myself,\" he said. \"Suppose I go along...?\"\n \n \"That,\" said Retief, \"should lend just the right note of solidarity to our little delegation.\" He hitched his chair closer. \"Now, depending on what we run into, here's how we'll play it....\"\n \n \n\n II\n \n Eight miles into the rolling granite hills west of the capital, a black-painted official air-car flying the twin flags of Chief of State and Terrestrial Minister skimmed along a foot above a pot-holed road. Slumped in the padded seat, the Boyar Chef d'Regime waved his cigar glumly at the surrounding hills.\n \n \"Fifty years ago this was bare rock,\" he said. \"We've bred special strains of bacteria here to break down the formations into soil, and we followed up with a program of broad-spectrum fertilization. We planned to put the whole area into crops by next year. Now it looks like the goats will get it.\"\n \n \"Will that scrubland support a crop?\" Retief said, eyeing the lichen-covered knolls.\n \n \"Sure. We start with legumes and follow up with cereals. Wait until you see this next section. It's an old flood plain, came into production thirty years ago. One of our finest—\"\n \n The air-car topped a rise. The Chef dropped his cigar and half rose, with a hoarse yell. A herd of scraggly goats tossed their heads among a stand of ripe grain. The car pulled to a stop. Retief held the Boyar's arm.\n \n \"Keep calm, Georges,\" he said. \"Remember, we're on a diplomatic mission. It wouldn't do to come to the conference table smelling of goats.\"\n \n \"Let me at 'em!\" Georges roared. \"I'll throttle 'em with my bare hands!\"\n \n A bearded goat eyed the Boyar Chef sardonically, jaw working. \"Look at that long-nosed son!\" The goat gave a derisive bleat and took another mouthful of ripe grain.\n \n \"Did you see that?\" Georges yelled. \"They've trained the son of a—\"\n \n \"Chin up, Georges,\" Retief said. \"We'll take up the goat problem along with the rest.\"\n \n \"I'll murder 'em!\"\n \n \"Hold it, Georges. Look over there.\"\n \n A hundred yards away, a trio of brown-cloaked horsemen topped a rise, paused dramatically against the cloudless pale sky, then galloped down the slope toward the car, rifles bobbing at their backs, cloaks billowing out behind. Side by side they rode, through the brown-golden grain, cutting three narrow swaths that ran in a straight sweep from the ridge to the air-car where Retief and the Chef d'Regime hovered, waiting.\n \n Georges scrambled for the side of the car. \"Just wait 'til I get my hands on him!\"\n \n Retief pulled him back. \"Sit tight and look pleased, Georges. Never give the opposition a hint of your true feelings. Pretend you're a goat lover—and hand me one of your cigars.\"\n \n The three horsemen pulled up in a churn of chaff and a clatter of pebbles. Georges coughed, batting a hand at the settling dust. Retief peeled the cigar unhurriedly, sniffed, at it and thumbed it alight. He drew at it, puffed out a cloud of smoke and glanced casually at the trio of Aga Kagan cavaliers.\n \n \"Peace be with you,\" he intoned in accent-free Kagan. \"May your shadows never grow less.\"\n \n \n\n \n The leader of the three, a hawk-faced man with a heavy beard, unlimbered his rifle. He fingered it, frowning ferociously.\n \n \"Have no fear,\" Retief said, smiling graciously. \"He who comes as a guest enjoys perfect safety.\"\n \n A smooth-faced member of the threesome barked an oath and leveled his rifle at Retief.\n \n \"Youth is the steed of folly,\" Retief said. \"Take care that the beardless one does not disgrace his house.\"\n \n The leader whirled on the youth and snarled an order. He lowered the rifle, muttering. Blackbeard turned back to Retief.\n \n \"Begone, interlopers,\" he said. \"You disturb the goats.\"\n \n \"Provision is not taken to the houses of the generous,\" Retief said.\n\"May the creatures dine well ere they move on.\"\n \n \"Hah! The goats of the Aga Kaga graze on the lands of the Aga Kaga.\" The leader edged his horse close, eyed Retief fiercely. \"We welcome no intruders on our lands.\"\n \n \"To praise a man for what he does not possess is to make him appear foolish,\" Retief said. \"These are the lands of the Boyars. But enough of these pleasantries. We seek audience with your ruler.\"\n \n \"You may address me as 'Exalted One',\" the leader said. \"Now dismount from that steed of Shaitan.\"\n \n \"It is written, if you need anything from a dog, call him 'sir',\" Retief said. \"I must decline to impute canine ancestry to a guest. Now you may conduct us to your headquarters.\"\n \n \"Enough of your insolence!\" The bearded man cocked his rifle. \"I could blow your heads off!\"\n \n \"The hen has feathers, but it does not fly,\" Retief said. \"We have asked for escort. A slave must be beaten with a stick; for a free man, a hint is enough.\"\n \n \"You mock me, pale one. I warn you—\"\n \n \"Only love makes me weep,\" Retief said. \"I laugh at hatred.\"\n \n \"Get out of the car!\"\n \n Retief puffed at his cigar, eyeing the Aga Kagan cheerfully. The youth in the rear moved forward, teeth bared.\n \n \"Never give in to the fool, lest he say, 'He fears me,'\" Retief said.\n \n \"I cannot restrain my men in the face of your insults,\" the bearded Aga Kagan roared. \"These hens of mine have feathers—and talons as well!\"\n \n \"When God would destroy an ant, he gives him wings,\" Retief said.\n\"Distress in misfortune is another misfortune.\"\n \n The bearded man's face grew purple.\n \n Retief dribbled the ash from his cigar over the side of the car.\n \n \"Now I think we'd better be getting on,\" he said briskly. \"I've enjoyed our chat, but we do have business to attend to.\"\n \n The bearded leader laughed shortly. \"Does the condemned man beg for the axe?\" he enquired rhetorically. \"You shall visit the Aga Kaga, then. Move on! And make no attempt to escape, else my gun will speak you a brief farewell.\"\n \n The horsemen glowered, then, at a word from the leader, took positions around the car. Georges started the vehicle forward, following the leading rider. Retief leaned back and let out a long sigh.\n \n \"That was close,\" he said. \"I was about out of proverbs.\"\n \n \"You sound as though you'd brought off a coup,\" Georges said. \"From the expression on the whiskery one's face, we're in for trouble. What was he saying?\"\n \n \"Just a routine exchange of bluffs,\" Retief said. \"Now when we get there, remember to make your flattery sound like insults and your insults sound like flattery, and you'll be all right.\"\n \n \"These birds are armed. And they don't like strangers,\" Georges said.\n\"Maybe I should have boned up on their habits before I joined this expedition.\"\n \n \"Just stick to the plan,\" Retief said. \"And remember: a handful of luck is better than a camel-load of learning.\"\n \n \n\n \n The air car followed the escort down a long slope to a dry river bed and across it, through a barren stretch of shifting sand to a green oasis set with canopies.\n \n The armed escort motioned the car to a halt before an immense tent of glistening black. Before the tent armed men lounged under a pennant bearing a lion couchant in crimson on a field verte.\n \n \"Get out,\" Blackbeard ordered. The guards eyed the visitors, their drawn sabers catching sunlight. Retief and Georges stepped from the car onto rich rugs spread on the grass. They followed the ferocious gesture of the bearded man through the opening into a perfumed interior of luminous shadows. A heavy odor of incense hung in the air, and the strumming of stringed instruments laid a muted pattern of sound behind the decorations of gold and blue, silver and green. At the far end of the room, among a bevy of female slaves, a large and resplendently clad man with blue-black hair and a clean-shaven chin popped a grape into his mouth. He wiped his fingers negligently on a wisp of silk offered by a handmaiden, belched loudly and looked the callers over.\n \n Blackbeard cleared his throat. \"Down on your faces in the presence of the Exalted One, the Aga Kaga, ruler of East and West.\"\n \n \"Sorry,\" Retief said firmly. \"My hay-fever, you know.\"\n \n The reclining giant waved a hand languidly.\n \n \"Never mind the formalities,\" he said. \"Approach.\"\n \n Retief and Georges crossed the thick rugs. A cold draft blew toward them. The reclining man sneezed violently, wiped his nose on another silken scarf and held up a hand.\n \n \"Night and the horses and the desert know me,\" he said in resonant tones. \"Also the sword and the guest and paper and pen—\" He paused, wrinkled his nose and sneezed again. \"Turn off that damned air-conditioner,\" he snapped.\n \n He settled himself and motioned the bearded man to him. The two exchanged muted remarks. Then the bearded man stepped back, ducked his head and withdrew to the rear.\n \n \"Excellency,\" Retief said, \"I have the honor to present M. Georges Duror, Chef d'Regime of the Planetary government.\"\n \n \"Planetary government?\" The Aga Kaga spat grape seeds on the rug. \"My men have observed a few squatters along the shore. If they're in distress, I'll see about a distribution of goat-meat.\"\n \n \"It is the punishment of the envious to grieve at anothers' plenty,\" Retief said. \"No goat-meat will be required.\"\n \n \"Ralph told me you talk like a page out of Mustapha ben Abdallah Katib Jelebi,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"I know a few old sayings myself. For example, 'A Bedouin is only cheated once.'\"\n \n \"We have no such intentions, Excellency,\" Retief said. \"Is it not written, 'Have no faith in the Prince whose minister cheats you'?\"\n \n \"I've had some unhappy experiences with strangers,\" the Aga Kaga said.\n\"It is written in the sands that all strangers are kin. Still, he who visits rarely is a welcome guest. Be seated.\"\n \n \n\n III\n \n Handmaidens brought cushions, giggled and fled. Retief and Georges settled themselves comfortably. The Aga Kaga eyed them in silence.\n \n \n\n \n \"We have come to bear tidings from the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne,\" Retief said solemnly. A perfumed slave girl offered grapes.\n \n \"Modest ignorance is better than boastful knowledge,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"What brings the CDT into the picture?\"\n \n \"The essay of the drunkard will be read in the tavern,\" Retief said.\n\"Whereas the words of kings....\"\n \n \"Very well, I concede the point.\" The Aga Kaga waved a hand at the serving maids. \"Depart, my dears. Attend me later. You too, Ralph. These are mere diplomats. They are men of words, not deeds.\"\n \n The bearded man glared and departed. The girls hurried after him.\n \n \"Now,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"Let's drop the wisdom of the ages and get down to the issues. Not that I don't admire your repertoire of platitudes. How do you remember them all?\"\n \n \"Diplomats and other liars require good memories,\" said Retief. \"But as you point out, small wisdom to small minds. I'm here to effect a settlement of certain differences between yourself and the planetary authorities. I have here a Note, which I'm conveying on behalf of the Sector Under-Secretary. With your permission, I'll read it.\"\n \n \"Go ahead.\" The Aga Kaga kicked a couple of cushions onto the floor, eased a bottle from under the couch and reached for glasses.\n \n \"The Under-Secretary for Sector Affairs presents his compliments to his Excellency, the Aga Kaga of the Aga Kaga, Primary Potentate, Hereditary Sheik, Emir of the—\"\n \n \"Yes, yes. Skip the titles.\"\n \n Retief flipped over two pages.\n \n \"... and with reference to the recent relocation of persons under the jurisdiction of his Excellency, has the honor to point out that the territories now under settlement comprise a portion of that area, hereinafter designated as Sub-sector Alpha, which, under terms of the Agreement entered into by his Excellency's predecessor, and as referenced in Sector Ministry's Notes numbers G-175846573957-b and X-7584736 c-1, with particular pertinence to that body designated in the Revised Galactic Catalogue, Tenth Edition, as amended, Volume Nine, reel 43, as 54 Cygni Alpha, otherwise referred to hereinafter as Flamme—\"\n \n \"Come to the point,\" the Aga Kaga cut in. \"You're here to lodge a complaint that I'm invading territories to which someone else lays claim, is that it?\" He smiled broadly, offered dope-sticks and lit one.\n\"Well, I've been expecting a call. After all, it's what you gentlemen are paid for. Cheers.\"\n \n \"Your Excellency has a lucid way of putting things,\" Retief said.\n \n \"Call me Stanley,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"The other routine is just to please some of the old fools—I mean the more conservative members of my government. They're still gnawing their beards and kicking themselves because their ancestors dropped science in favor of alchemy and got themselves stranded in a cultural dead end. This charade is supposed to prove they were right all along. However, I've no time to waste in neurotic compensations. I have places to go and deeds to accomplish.\"\n \n \"At first glance,\" Retief said, \"it looks as though the places are already occupied, and the deeds are illegal.\"\n \n \n\n \n The Aga Kaga guffawed. \"For a diplomat, you speak plainly, Retief. Have another drink.\" He poured, eyeing Georges. \"What of M. Duror? How does he feel about it?\"\n \n Georges took a thoughtful swallow of whiskey. \"Not bad,\" he said. \"But not quite good enough to cover the odor of goats.\"\n \n The Aga Kaga snorted. \"I thought the goats were overdoing it a bit myself,\" he said. \"Still, the graybeards insisted. And I need their support.\"\n \n \"Also,\" Georges said distinctly, \"I think you're soft. You lie around letting women wait on you, while your betters are out doing an honest day's work.\"\n \n The Aga Kaga looked startled. \"Soft? I can tie a knot in an iron bar as big as your thumb.\" He popped a grape into his mouth. \"As for the rest, your pious views about the virtues of hard labor are as childish as my advisors' faith in the advantages of primitive plumbing. As for myself, I am a realist. If two monkeys want the same banana, in the end one will have it, and the other will cry morality. The days of my years are numbered, praise be to God. While they last, I hope to eat well, hunt well, fight well and take my share of pleasure. I leave to others the arid satisfactions of self-denial and other perversions.\"\n \n \"You admit you're here to grab our land, then,\" Georges said. \"That's the damnedest piece of bare-faced aggression—\"\n \n \"Ah, ah!\" The Aga Kaga held up a hand. \"Watch your vocabulary, my dear sir. I'm sure that 'justifiable yearnings for territorial self-realization' would be more appropriate to the situation. Or possibly 'legitimate aspirations, for self-determination of formerly exploited peoples' might fit the case. Aggression is, by definition, an activity carried on only by those who have inherited the mantle of Colonial Imperialism.\"\n \n \"Imperialism! Why, you Aga Kagans have been the most notorious planet-grabbers in Sector history, you—you—\"\n \n \"Call me Stanley.\" The Aga Kaga munched a grape. \"I merely face the realities of popular folk-lore. Let's be pragmatic; it's a matter of historical association. Some people can grab land and pass it off lightly as a moral duty; others are dubbed imperialist merely for holding onto their own. Unfair, you say. But that's life, my friends. And I shall continue to take every advantage of it.\"\n \n \"We'll fight you!\" Georges bellowed. He took another gulp of whiskey and slammed the glass down. \"You won't take this world without a struggle!\"\n \n \"Another?\" the Aga Kaga said, offering the bottle. Georges glowered as his glass was filled. The Aga Kaga held the glass up to the light.\n \n \"Excellent color, don't you agree?\" He turned his eyes on Georges.\n \n \"It's pointless to resist,\" he said. \"We have you outgunned and outmanned. Your small nation has no chance against us. But we're prepared to be generous. You may continue to occupy such areas as we do not immediately require until such time as you're able to make other arrangements.\"\n \n \"And by the time we've got a crop growing out of what was bare rock, you'll be ready to move in,\" the Boyar Chef d'Regime snapped. \"But you'll find that we aren't alone!\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Quite alone,\" the Aga said. He nodded sagely. \"Yes, one need but read the lesson of history. The Corps Diplomatique will make expostulatory noises, but it will accept the fait accompli . You, my dear sir, are but a very small nibble. We won't make the mistake of excessive greed. We shall inch our way to empire—and those who stand in our way shall be dubbed warmongers.\"\n \n \"I see you're quite a student of history, Stanley,\" Retief said. \"I wonder if you recall the eventual fate of most of the would-be empire nibblers of the past?\"\n \n \"Ah, but they grew incautious. They went too far, too fast.\"\n \n \"The confounded impudence,\" Georges rasped. \"Tells us to our face what he has in mind!\"\n \n \"An ancient and honorable custom, from the time of Mein Kampf and the Communist Manifesto through the Porcelain Wall of Leung. Such declarations have a legendary quality. It's traditional that they're never taken at face value.\"\n \n \"But always,\" Retief said, \"there was a critical point at which the man on horseback could have been pulled from the saddle.\"\n \n \" Could have been,\" the Aga Kaga chuckled. He finished the grapes and began peeling an orange. \"But they never were. Hitler could have been stopped by the Czech Air Force in 1938; Stalin was at the mercy of the primitive atomics of the west in 1946; Leung was grossly over-extended at Rangoon. But the onus of that historic role could not be overcome. It has been the fate of your spiritual forebears to carve civilization from the wilderness and then, amid tearing of garments and the heaping of ashes of self-accusation on your own confused heads, to withdraw, leaving the spoils for local political opportunists and mob leaders, clothed in the mystical virtue of native birth. Have a banana.\"\n \n \"You're stretching your analogy a little too far,\" Retief said. \"You're banking on the inaction of the Corps. You could be wrong.\"\n \n \"I shall know when to stop,\" the Aga Kaga said.\n \n \"Tell me, Stanley,\" Retief said, rising. \"Are we quite private here?\"\n \n \"Yes, perfectly so,\" the Aga Kaga said. \"None would dare to intrude in my council.\" He cocked an eyebrow at Retief. \"You have a proposal to make in confidence? But what of our dear friend Georges? One would not like to see him disillusioned.\"\n \n \"Don't worry about Georges. He's a realist, like you. He's prepared to deal in facts. Hard facts, in this case.\"\n \n The Aga Kaga nodded thoughtfully. \"What are you getting at?\"\n \n \"You're basing your plan of action on the certainty that the Corps will sit by, wringing its hands, while you embark on a career of planetary piracy.\"\n \n \"Isn't it the custom?\" the Aga Kaga smiled complacently.\n \n \"I have news for you, Stanley. In this instance, neck-wringing seems more in order than hand-wringing.\"\n \n The Aga Kaga frowned. \"Your manner—\"\n \n \"Never mind our manners!\" Georges blurted, standing. \"We don't need any lessons from goat-herding land-thieves!\"\n \n The Aga Kaga's face darkened. \"You dare to speak thus to me, pig of a muck-grubber!\"", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "61285", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

You had to give up hope and freedom—and being human!\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, November 1963. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n I\n \n The girl with the Slider egg glittering in her hair watched the bailiff lead Asa Graybar out of the courtroom. He recognized her as old Hazeltyne's daughter Harriet, no doubt come to see justice done. She didn't have the hothouse-flower look Asa would have expected in a girl whose father owned the most valuable of the planetary franchises. She was not afraid to meet his eye, the eye of a judicially certified criminal. There was, perhaps, a crease of puzzlement in her brow, as if she had thought crimes were committed by shriveled, rat-faced types, and not by young biological engineers who still affected crewcuts.\n \n Tom Dorr, Hazeltyne's general manager, was her escort. Asa felt certain, without proof, that Dorr was the man who had framed him for the charge of grand theft by secreting a fresh Slider egg in his laboratory. The older man stared at Asa coldly as he was led out of the courtroom and down the corridor back to jail.\n \n Jumpy, Asa's cellmate, took one look at his face as he was put back behind bars.\n \n \"Guilty,\" Jumpy said.\n \n Asa glared at him.\n \n \"I know, I know,\" Jumpy said hastily. \"You were framed. But what's the rap?\"\n \n \"Five or one.\"\n \n \"Take the five,\" Jumpy advised. \"Learn basket-weaving in a nice air-conditioned rehab clinic. A year on a changeling deal will seem a lot longer, even if you're lucky enough to live through it.\"\n \n Asa took four steps to the far wall of the cell, stood there briefly with his head bent and turned to face Jumpy.\n \n \"Nope,\" Asa said softly. \"I'm going into a conversion tank. I'm going to be a muck man, Jumpy. I'm going out to Jordan's Planet and hunt Slider eggs.\"\n \n \"Smuggling? It won't work.\"\n \n Asa didn't answer. The Hazeltyne company had gone after him because he had been working on a method of keeping Slider eggs alive. The Hazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years of so-called social reorientation. But if he could get out to Jordan's Planet, with his physiology adapted to the environment of that wretched world, he could study the eggs under conditions no laboratory could duplicate. He might even be able to cause trouble for Hazeltyne.\n \n His only problem would be staying alive for a year.\n \n \n\n \n An interview with a doctor from the Conversion Corps was required for all persons who elected changeling status. The law stated that potential changelings must be fully informed of the rights and hazards of altered shape before they signed a release. The requirement held whether or not the individual, like Asa, was already experienced.\n \n By the time humanity traveled to the stars, medical biology had made it possible to regenerate damaged or deficient organs of the body. Regeneration was limited only by advanced age. Sometime after a man's two hundredth year his body lost the ability to be coaxed into growing new cells. A fifth set of teeth was usually one's last. As long as senescence could be staved off, however, any man could have bulging biceps and a pencil waist, if he could pay for the treatment.\n \n Until the medical associations declared such treatments unethical there was even a short fad of deliberate deformities, with horns at the temples particularly popular.\n \n From regeneration it was a short step to specialized regrowth. The techniques were perfected to adapt humans to the dozen barely habitable worlds man had discovered. Even on Mars, the only planet outside Earth in the solar system where the human anatomy was remotely suitable, a man could work more efficiently with redesigned lungs and temperature controls than he could inside a pressure suit. On more bizarre planets a few light-years away the advantages of changeling bodies were greater.\n \n Unfortunately for planetary development companies, hardly anyone wanted to become a changeling. High pay lured few. So a law was passed permitting a convicted criminal to earn his freedom by putting in one year as a changeling for every five years he would otherwise have had to spend in rehabilitation.\n \n \"What types of changelings do you have orders for right now, doctor?\" Asa asked the man assigned to his case. It would look suspicious if he asked for Jordan's Planet without some preliminary questions.\n \n \"Four,\" answered the doctor.\n \n \"Squiffs for New Arcady. Adapted for climbing the skycraper trees and with the arm structure modified into pseudo-wings or gliding. Then we need spiderinos for Von Neumann Two. If you want the nearest thing we have to Earth, there's Caesar's Moon, where we'd just have to double your tolerance for carbon monoxide and make you a bigger and better gorilla than the natives. Last, of course, there's always a need for muck men on Jordan's Planet.\"\n \n The doctor shrugged, as if naturally no one could be expected to choose Jordan's Planet. Asa frowned in apparent consideration of the alternatives.\n \n \"What's the pay range?\" he asked.\n \n \"Ten dollars a day on Caesar's Moon. Fifteen on New Arcady or Von Neumann Two. Twenty-five on Jordan's.\"\n \n Asa raised his eyebrows.\n \n \"Why such a difference? Everyone knows about muck men living in the mud while they hunt Slider eggs. But don't your conversions make the changeling comfortable in his new environment?\"\n \n \"Sure they do,\" said the doctor. \"We can make you think mud feels better than chinchilla fur and we can have you jumping like a grasshopper despite the double gravity. But we can't make you like the sight of yourself. And we can't guarantee that a Slider won't kill you.\"\n \n \"Still,\" Asa mused aloud, \"it would mean a nice bankroll waiting at the end of the year.\"\n \n He leaned forward to fill in the necessary form.\n \n \n\n \n Since it was cheaper to transport a normal human than to rig special environments in a spaceship, every planet operated its own conversion chambers. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth Asa Graybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guard to bring meals and take out dirty dishes. He was still a prisoner.\n \n Sometimes he could hear voices in the passageway outside, and once one of them sounded like a woman's. But since women neither served on spaceships nor worked in the dome settlements on harsher worlds, he decided it was his imagination. He might have been dead cargo for all he learned about space travel.\n \n Nevertheless his time was not wasted. He had as a companion, or cellmate, another convict who had elected conversion to muck man. More important, his companion had done time on Jordan's Planet before and had wanted to return.\n \n \"It's the Slider eggs,\" explained Kershaw, the two-time loser. \"The ones you see on Earth knock your eyes out, but they've already begun to die. There's nothing like a fresh one. And I'm not the first to go crazy over them. When I was reconverted and got home I had nine thousand dollars waiting for me. That'll buy a two-year-old egg that flashes maybe four times a day. So I stole a new one and got caught.\"\n \n Asa had held a Slider egg in his hand as he gazed into it. He could understand. The shell was clear as crystal, taut but elastic, while the albumen was just as clear around the sparkling network of organic filaments that served as a yolk. Along these interior threads played tiny flashes of lightning, part of some unexplained process of life. Electrical instruments picked up static discharges from the egg, but the phenomenon remained a mystery.\n \n Hardly anyone faced with the beauty of a Slider's egg bothered to question its workings. For a few expectant moments there would be only random, fitful gleamings, and then there would be a wild coruscation of light, dancing from one filament to the next in a frenzy of brilliance.\n \n It took about four years for a Slider egg to die. Beauty, rarity and fading value made the eggs a luxury item like nothing the world had ever seen. If Asa had found a means of keeping them alive it would have made him wealthy at the expense of the Hazeltyne monopoly.\n \n \"You know what I think?\" Kershaw asked. \"I think those flashes are the egg calling its momma. They sparkle like a million diamonds when you scoop one out of the muck, and right away a Slider always comes swooping out of nowhere at you.\"\n \n \"I've been meaning to ask you,\" Asa said. \"How do you handle the Sliders?\"\n \n Kershaw grinned.\n \n \"First you try to catch it with a rocket. If you miss you start leaping for home. All this time you're broadcasting for help, you understand. When the Slider catches you, you leap up while it buries its jaws in the mud where you were just standing. You dig your claws in its back and hang on while it rolls around in the mud. Finally, if the 'copter comes—and if they don't shoot off your head by mistake—you live to tell the tale.\"\n \n \n\n II\n \n Asa Graybar kept his normal form on Jordan's Planet just long enough to learn the discomfort of double gravity. He was told he needed another physical examination and was taken right in to a doctor. His heart was pounding to keep his blood circulating on this massive world, but the doctor had apparently learned to make allowances.\n \n \"Swallow this,\" said the doctor after making a series of tests.\n \n Asa swallowed the capsule. Two minutes later he felt himself beginning to lose consciousness.\n \n \"This is it!\" he thought in panic.\n \n He felt someone ease him back down onto a wheeled stretcher. Before consciousness faded completely he realized that no one got a chance to back out of becoming a changeling, that he was on his way to the conversion tank right now.\n \n When he finally awoke he felt well rested and very comfortable. But for a long time he was afraid to open his eyes.\n \n \"Come on, Graybar,\" said a deep, booming voice. \"Let's test our wings.\"\n \n It was not Kershaw's voice, but it had to be Kershaw. Asa opened his eyes.\n \n Everyone had seen pictures of muck men. It was different having one stand beside you. Kershaw looked much like an enormous frog except that his head was still mostly human. He was sitting on webbed feet, his lower legs bent double under huge thighs, and his trunk tilted forward so that his arms dangled to the ground. The arms were as thick around as an ordinary man's legs. The hands had become efficient scoops, with broad fingers webbed to the first joint and tipped with spade-like claws. The skin was still pinkish but had become scaly. Not a thread of hair showed anywhere on the body, not even on the head.\n \n This, Asa realized, was what he looked like himself.\n \n It would have been more bearable if the head had not retained strong traces of humanity. The nostrils flared wide and the jaws hardly emerged from the neck, but the ears were human ears and the eyes, under those horny ridges, were human eyes. Asa felt sure that the eyes could still weep.\n \n He started to walk forward and tipped over on his side. Kershaw laughed.\n \n \"Come to daddy, babykins,\" Kershaw said, holding out his hands. \"Only try hopping this time. And take it easy.\"\n \n Asa pushed himself upright with one arm and tried a small hop. Nerve and muscle coordination was perfect. He found himself leaping as high as Kershaw's head.\n \n \"That's the way,\" Kershaw said approvingly. \"Now get this on and we'll go outside.\"\n \n Asa snapped on a belt and breech cloth combination that had flaps of fabric dangling from the belt in front and behind. He followed as Kershaw pushed open a sliding door to lead the way out of the room where they had been left to revive from conversion.\n \n \n\n \n They went into a courtyard partly covered by a roof projecting from the Hazeltyne company's dome settlement. The far half of the courtyard was open to the gray drizzle that fell almost ceaselessly from the sky of Jordan's Planet and turned most of its surface into marsh and mud flats. A high wall enclosed the far portion of the courtyard. Ranged along the wall were thirty stalls for muck men.\n \n From fifty yards across the courtyard a muck man bounded over to them in two leaps. Attached to a harness across his shoulders and chest were a gun and a long knife.\n \n \"Names?\" he growled. He was a foot taller than Graybar and big everywhere in proportion.\n \n \"Kershaw. I'm back, Furston.\"\n \n \"I'm Graybar.\"\n \n \"Kershaw again? Just start in where you left off, sucker. Come on, you.\" He pointed to Asa and leaped to the open portion of the courtyard.\n \n \"Do what he says,\" Kershaw whispered to Graybar. \"He's sort of a trusty and warden and parole officer rolled into one.\"\n \n Asa was put through a series of exercises to get him used to his distorted body, to teach him how to leap and how to dig. He was shown how to operate the radio he would carry and how to fire the pencil-slim rockets of this gun. Finally he was told to eat a few berries from a native vine. He did so and immediately vomited.\n \n Furston laughed.\n \n \"That's to remind you you're still a man,\" Furston said, grinning.\n\"Everything that grows on this planet is poison. So if you got any ideas of hiding out till your term is up, forget 'em. Right here is where you eat.\"\n \n Asa turned without a word and hopped feebly away from Furston. He lifted his head to breathe deeply and saw two humans watching him from an observation tower on the roof.\n \n He leaped twenty feet into the air for a closer look.\n \n Gazing at him with repugnance, after witnessing the end of his session with Furston, were Harriet Hazeltyne and general manager Tom Dorr.\n \n The girl's presence merely puzzled Asa, but Dorr's being here worried him. Dorr had tried to get rid of him once and was now in an excellent position to make the riddance permanent.\n \n At supper that night, squatting on the ground beside a low table with the dozen other muck men operating from the dome, Asa asked what the two were doing out here.\n \n \"The girl will inherit this racket some day, won't she?\" asked one of the others. \"She wants to see what kind of suckers are making her rich.\"\n \n \"Maybe that guy Dorr brought her along to show her what a big wheel he is,\" said one of the others. \"Just hope he doesn't take over the operations.\"\n \n \n\n III\n \n Next morning Furston passed out guns, knives, radios, and pouches to carry any eggs the muck men found. He gave each man a compass and assigned the sectors to be worked during the day. Finally he called Graybar aside.\n \n \"In case you don't like it here,\" Furston said, \"you can get a week knocked off your sentence for every egg you bring in. Now get out there and work that muck.\"\n \n Furston sent Graybar and Kershaw out together so that the veteran could show Asa the ropes. Asa had already learned that the wall around the courtyard was to keep Sliders out, not muck men in. He leaped over it and hopped along after Kershaw.\n \n Feet slapping against the mud, they went about five miles from the Hazeltyne station, swimming easily across ponds too broad to jump. The mud, if not precisely as pleasant to the touch as chinchilla fur, was not at all uncomfortable, and the dripping air caressed their skins like a summer breeze back on Earth. Tiny, slippery creatures skidded and splashed out of their way. Finally Kershaw stopped. His experienced eye had seen a trail of swamp weeds crushed low into the mud.\n \n \"Keep your eyes open,\" Kershaw said. \"There's a Slider been around here lately. If you see something like an express train headed our way, start shooting.\"\n \n At each leap along the trail they peered quickly around. They saw no Sliders, but this meant little, for the beasts lived under the mud as much as on top of it.\n \n Kershaw halted again when they came to a roughly circular area some ten yards in diameter where the weeds had been torn out and lay rotting in the muck.\n \n \"We're in luck,\" he said as Asa skidded to a stop at his side. \"An egg was laid somewhere here within the last week. These places are hard to spot when the new weeds start growing.\"\n \n Kershaw took a long look around.\n \n \"No trouble in sight. We dig.\"\n \n They started at the center of the cleared area, shoveling up great gobs of mud with their hands and flinging them out of the clearing. Usually a muck man dug in a spiral out from the center, but Graybar and Kershaw dug in gradually widening semi-circles opposite each other. They had to dig four feet deep, and it was slow going until they had a pit big enough to stand in. Each handful of mud had to be squeezed gently before it was thrown away, to make sure it didn't conceal an egg. As he worked, Asa kept thinking what an inefficient system it was. Everything about the operation was wrong.\n \n \"Got it!\" Kershaw shouted. He leaped out of the pit and started wiping slime off a round object the size of a baseball. Asa jumped out to watch.\n \n \"A big one,\" Kershaw said. He held it, still smeared with traces of mud, lovingly to his cheek, and then lifted it to eye level. \"Just look at it.\"\n \n \n \n A SLIDER EGG\n \n \n \n The egg was flashing with a mad radiance, like a thousand diamonds being splintered under a brilliant sun. Static crackled in Asa's earphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that the scintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Slider for help. Asa looked around.\n \n \"Jump!\" he shouted.\n \n At the edge of the clearing a segmented length of greenish black scales, some two feet thick and six feet high, had reared up out of the weeds. The top segment was almost all mouth, already opened to show row upon row of teeth. Before Asa could draw his gun the Slider lowered its head to the ground, dug two front flippers into the mud and shot forward.\n \n Asa leaped with all his strength, sailing far out of the clearing. While he was still in the air he snapped the mouthpiece of his radio down from where it was hinged over his head. As he landed he turned instantly, his gun in his hand.\n \n \"Calling the 'copter!\" he spoke rapidly into the mouthpiece. \"Kershaw and Graybar, sector eight, five miles out. Hurry!\"\n \n \"Graybar?\" asked a voice in his earphone. \"What's up?\"\n \n \"We've got an egg but a Slider wants it back.\"\n \n \"On the way.\"\n \n Asa hopped back to the clearing. Kershaw must have been bowled over by the Slider's first rush, for he was trying to hop on one leg as if the other had been broken. The egg lay flickering on top of the mud where Kershaw had dropped it. The Slider, eight flippers on each side working madly, was twisting its thirty feet of wormlike body around for another charge.\n \n Aiming hastily, Asa fired a rocket at the monster's middle segment. The rocket smashed through hard scales and exploded in a fountain of gray flesh. The Slider writhed, coating its wound in mud, and twisted toward Asa. He leaped to one side, firing from the air and missing, and saw the Slider turn toward the patch of weeds where he would land. His legs were tensed to leap again the moment he hit the mud, but he saw the Slider would be on top of him before he could escape. As he landed he thrust his gun forward almost into the mouth of the creature and fired again.\n \n \n\n \n Even as he was knocked aside into the muck, Asa's body was showered with shreds of alien flesh scattered by the rocket's explosion. Desperately pushing himself to his feet, he saw the long headless body shiver and lie still.\n \n \n\n \n Asa took a deep breath and looked around.\n \n \"Kershaw!\" he called. \"Where are you?\"\n \n \"Over here.\" Kershaw stood briefly above the weeds and fell back again. Asa leaped over to him.\n \n \"Thanks,\" Kershaw said. \"Muck men stick together. You'll make a good one. I wouldn't have had a chance. My leg's busted.\"\n \n \"The helicopter ought to be here pretty soon,\" Asa said. He looked over at the dead Slider and shook his head. \"Tell me, what are the odds on getting killed doing this?\"\n \n \"Last time I was here there was about one mucker killed for every six eggs brought out. Of course you're not supposed to stand there admiring the eggs like I did while a Slider comes up on you.\"\n \n Asa hopped over to the egg, which was still full of a dancing radiance where it rested on the mud. He scooped a hole in the muck and buried the egg.\n \n \"Just in case there are any more Sliders around,\" he explained.\n \n \"Makes no difference,\" said Kershaw, pointing upward. \"Here comes the\n'copter, late as usual.\"\n \n The big machine circled them, hovered to inspect the dead Slider, and settled down on broad skids. Through the transparent nose Asa could see Tom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. The company manager swung the door open and leaned out.\n \n \"I see you took care of the Slider,\" he said. \"Hand over the egg.\"\n \n \"Kershaw has a broken leg,\" Asa said. \"I'll help him in and then I'll get the egg.\"\n \n While Kershaw grabbed the door frame to help pull himself into the helicopter, Asa got under his companion's belly and lifted him by the waist. He hadn't realized before just how strong his new body was. Kershaw, as a muck man, would have weighed close to three hundred pounds on Earth, close to six hundred here.\n \n Dorr made no move to help, but the girl reached under Kershaw's shoulder and strained to get him in. Once he was inside, Asa saw, the cabin was crowded.\n \n \"Are you going to have room for me too?\" he asked.\n \n \"Not this trip,\" Dorr answered. \"Now give me the egg.\"\n \n Asa didn't hesitate. \"The egg stays with me,\" he said softly.\n \n \"You do what I tell you, mucker,\" said Dorr.\n \n \"Nope. I want to make sure you come back.\" Asa turned his head to Harriet. \"You see, Miss Hazeltyne, I don't trust your friend. You might ask him to tell you about it.\"\n \n Dorr stared at him with narrowed eyes. Suddenly he smiled in a way that worried Asa.\n \n \"Whatever you say, Graybar,\" Dorr said. He turned to the controls. In another minute the helicopter was in the sky.\n \n \n\n \n A round trip for the helicopter should have taken no more than twenty minutes, allowing time for Kershaw to be taken out at the settlement.\n \n After an hour passed Asa began to worry. He was sure Dorr would return for the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the egg approximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for the egg any time with some other muck man to dig for it.\n \n Asa pulled down the mouthpiece of his radio.\n \n \"This is Graybar, calling the helicopter,\" he said. \"When are you coming?\"\n \n There was no answer except the hum of carrier wave.\n \n If he tried to carry the egg back, Asa knew, Sliders would attack him all along the way. A man had no chance of getting five miles with an egg by himself. He could leave the egg here, of course. Even so he would be lucky if he got back, following a hazy compass course from which he and Kershaw had certainly deviated on their outward trip. There were no landmarks in this wilderness of bog to help him find his way. The workers were supposed to home in on radio signals, if they lost their bearings, but Dorr would deny him that help.\n \n What was the night like on Jordan's Planet? Maybe Sliders slept at night. If he could stay awake, and if he didn't faint from hunger in this strange new body, and if the Sliders left him alone....\n \n A whirring noise made Asa jump in alarm.\n \n Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed helicopter, coming in over the swamp. But what if it was Dorr, coming back alone to dispose of him without any witnesses? Asa leaped for the carcass of the dead Slider and took shelter behind it.\n \n No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter. The big machine swooped low dizzily, tilted back in an inexpert attempt to hover, thumped down upon the mud and slid forward. As Asa jumped aside, the landing skids caught against the Slider's body and the helicopter flipped forward on its nose, one of the rotor blades plunging deep into the mud.\n \n Asa leaped forward in consternation. Not only was his chance of safe passage back to the settlement wrecked, but now he would have the extra burden of taking care of the pilot. When he reached the nose of the helicopter he saw that the pilot, untangling herself from the controls to get up, was Harriet Hazeltyne.\n \n \n\n IV\n \n \"Are you hurt?\" Asa asked her. She reached for his shoulder to steady herself as she climbed out of the machine.\n \n \"I guess not,\" she said. \"But taking a fall in this gravity is no fun. From the way my face feels I ought to be getting a black eye pretty soon.\"\n \n \"What happened?\"\n \n \"I made a fool of myself.\" She made a face back in the direction of the settlement. \"Dorr wasn't going to come after you. He said anyone who talked back to him should try arguing with the Sliders.\"\n \n She looked up at the machine-gun on the helicopter.\n \n \"They feed at night, you know. And they eat their own kind,\" she said.\n\"The Slider you killed would draw them like ants to jam.\"\n \n Asa glanced around quickly to make sure no Sliders had already come. He eyed the helicopter with distaste at the thought of what a flimsy fort it would make.\n \n \"Anyway,\" Harriet said, \"I told him he couldn't just leave you here and we started arguing. I lost my temper. He thought he had brought me to Jordan's Planet on a fancy tour. I told him the real reason I was here was to check up for my father on the way he was running things and there seemed to be a lot wrong. So he told me very politely I could run things to suit myself and he walked off.\"\n \n She shrugged, as if to indicate that she had made a mess of things.\n \n \"And you took the helicopter by yourself,\" Asa said, as if he could hardly believe it yet.\n \n \"Oh, back on Earth I can make a helicopter do stunts. But I wasn't used to this gravity. I don't suppose you could make this machine stand up straight?\"\n \n Asa tugged at the body of the Slider until he got it off the skids of the plane. He pulled with all his strength at the rotor blade sunk in the mud, but the weight of the helicopter was upon it and the mud held it with a suction of its own. After a few minutes he had to give up.\n \n \"We fight off the Sliders, then,\" she said, as matter of factly as if that problem was settled. \"If it's any comfort, I know how to handle the machine-gun.\"\n \n \"Nope. In this drizzle, at night, the Sliders would be on us before we could see them. We've got to try to get back.\" He stood in thought while she stared at him patiently. \"What happened to the other muck men who went out today?\" he asked.\n \n \"They were called in when the 'copter came out the first time. Some of them may not have got back yet.\"", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "61467", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

HARNESS\n \n \n Two mighty metal globes clung in a murderous death-struggle, lashing out with flames of poison. Yet deep in their twisted, radioactive wreckage the main battle raged—where a girl swayed sensuously before her conqueror's mocking eyes.\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1949. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n At first there was only the voice, a monotonous murmur in her ears.\n \n \" Die now—die now—die now —\"\n \n Evelyn Kane awoke, breathing slowly and painfully. The top of the cubicle was bulging inward on her chest, and it seemed likely that a rib or two was broken. How long ago? Years? Minutes? She had no way of knowing. Her slender right hand found the oxygen valve and turned it. For a long while she lay, hurting and breathing helplessly.\n \n \" Die now—die now—die now —\"\n \n The votron had awakened her with its heart-breaking code message, and it was her duty to carry out its command. Nine years after the great battle globes had crunched together the mentors had sealed her in this tiny cell, dormant, unwaking, to be livened only when it was certain her countrymen had either definitely won—or lost.\n \n The votron's telepathic dirge chronicled the latter fact. She had expected nothing else.\n \n She had only to find the relay beside her cot, press the key that would set in motion gigantic prime movers in the heart of the great globe, and the conquerors would join the conquered in the wide and nameless grave of space.\n \n But life, now doled out by the second, was too delicious to abandon immediately. Her mind, like that of a drowning person, raced hungrily over the memories of her past.\n \n For twenty years, in company with her great father, she had watched The Defender grow from a vast metal skeleton into a planet-sized battle globe. But it had not grown fast enough, for when the Scythian globe, The Invader , sprang out of black space to enslave the budding Terran Confederacy, The Defender was unfinished, half-equipped, and undermanned.\n \n The Terrans could only fight for time and hope for a miracle.\n  The Defender , commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurled itself from its orbit around Procyon and met The Invader with giant fission torpedoes.\n \n And then, in an intergalactic proton storm beyond the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, the globes lost their bearings and collided. Hordes of brute-men poured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken Defender .\n \n The prone woman stirred uneasily. Here the images became unreal and terrible, with the recurrent vision of death. It had taken the Scythians nine years to conquer The Defender's outer shell. Then had come that final interview with her father.\n \n \"In half an hour our last space port will be captured,\" he had telepathed curtly. \"Only one more messenger ship can leave The Defender . Be on it.\"\n \n \"No. I shall die here.\"\n \n His fine tired eyes had studied her face in enigmatic appraisal. \"Then die usefully. The mentors are trying to develop a force that will destroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they are successful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of the battle.\"\n \n \"There's an off-chance you may survive,\" countered a mentor. \"We're also working on a means for your escape—not only because you are Gordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will prevent radio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape with our secret if and when our experiments prove successful.\"\n \n \"But you must expect to die,\" her father had warned with gentle finality.\n \n She clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenched herself back to the present.\n \n That time had come.\n \n With some effort she worked herself out of the crumpled bed and lay on the floor of her little cubicle, panting and holding her chest with both hands. The metal floor was very cold. Evidently the enemy torpedo fissionables had finally broken through to the center portions of the ship, letting in the icy breath of space. Small matter. Not by freezing would she die.\n \n She reached out her hand, felt for the all-important key, and gasped in dismay. The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bonds and was lying on its side. The explosion that had crushed her cubicle had been terrific.\n \n With a gurgle of horror she snapped on her wrist luminar and examined the interior of the box.\n \n It was a shattered ruin.\n \n \n\n \n Once the fact was clear, she composed herself and lay there, breathing hard and thinking. She had no means to construct another key. At best, finding the rare tools and parts would take months, and during the interval the invaders would be cutting loose from the dead hulk that clutched their conquering battle globe in a metallic rigor mortis.\n \n She gave herself six weeks to accomplish this stalemate in space.\n \n Within that time she must know whether the prime movers were still intact, and whether she could safely enter the pile room herself, set the movers in motion, and draw the moderator columns. If it were unsafe, she must secure the unwitting assistance of her Scythian enemies.\n \n Still prone, she found the first-aid kit and taped her chest expertly. The cold was beginning to make itself felt, so she flicked on the chaudiere she wore as an under-garment to her Scythian woman's uniform. Then she crawled on her elbows and stomach to the tiny door, spun the sealing gear, and was soon outside. Ignoring the pain and pulling on the side of the imitation rock that contained her cell, she got slowly to her feet. The air was thin indeed, and frigid. She turned the valve of her portable oxygen bottle almost subconsciously, while exploring the surrounding blackened forest as far as she could see. Mentally she was alert for roving alien minds. She had left her weapons inside the cubicle, except for the three things in the little leather bag dangling from her waist, for she knew that her greatest weapon in the struggle to come would be her apparent harmlessness.\n \n Four hundred yards behind her she detected the mind of a low-born Scythe, of the Tharn sun group. Very quickly she established it as that of a tired, brutish corporal, taking a mop-up squad through the black stumps and forlorn branches of the small forest that for years had supplied oxygen to the defenders of this sector.\n \n The corporal could not see her green Scythian uniform clearly, and evidently took her for a Terran woman. In his mind was the question: Should he shoot immediately, or should he capture her? It had been two months since he had seen a woman. But then, his orders were to shoot. Yes, he would shoot.\n \n Evelyn turned in profile to the beam-gun and stretched luxuriously, hoping that her grimace of pain could not be detected. With satisfaction, she sensed a sudden change of determination in the mind of the Tharn. The gun was lowered, and the man was circling to creep up behind her. He did not bother to notify his men. He wanted her first. He had seen her uniform, but that deterred him not a whit. Afterwards, he would call up the squad. Finally, they would kill her and move on. Women auxiliaries had no business here, anyway.\n \n Hips dipping, Evelyn sauntered into the shattered copse. The man moved faster, though still trying to approach quietly. Most of the radions in the mile-high ceiling had been destroyed, and the light was poor. He was not surprised when he lost track of his quarry. He tip-toed rapidly onward, picking his way through the charred and fallen branches, thinking that she must turn up again soon. He had not gone twenty yards in this manner when a howl of unbearable fury sounded in his mind, and the dull light in his brain went out.\n \n \n She fought for her life under that mile-high ceiling.\n \n\n \n Breathing deeply from her mental effort, the woman stepped from behind a great black tree trunk and hurried to the unconscious man. For I.Q.'s of 100 and less, telepathic cortical paralysis was quite effective. With cool efficiency and no trace of distaste she stripped the odorous uniform from the man, then took his weapon, turned the beam power down very low, and needled a neat slash across his throat. While he bled to death, she slipped deftly into the baggy suit, clasped the beam gun by the handle, and started up the sooty slope. For a time, at least, it would be safer to pass as a Tharn soldier than as any kind of a woman.\n \n \n\n II\n \n The inquisitor leaned forward, frowning at the girl before him.\n \n \"Name?\"\n \n \"Evelyn Kane.\"\n \n The eyes of the inquisitor widened. \"So you admit to a Terran name. Well, Terran, you are charged with having stolen passage on a supply lorry, and you also seem to be wearing the uniform of an infantry corporal as well as that of a Scythian woman auxiliary. Incidentally, where is the corporal? Did you kill him?\"\n \n He was prepared for a last-ditch denial. He would cut it short, have the guards remove her, and execution would follow immediately. In a way, it was unfortunate. The woman was obviously of a high Terran class. No—he couldn't consider that. His slender means couldn't afford another woman in his quarters, and besides, he wouldn't feel safe with this cool murderess.\n \n \"Do you not understand the master tongue? Why did you kill the corporal?\" He leaned impatiently over his desk.\n \n The woman stared frankly back at him with her clear blue eyes. The guards on either side of her dug their nails into her arms, as was their custom with recalcitrant prisoners, but she took no notice.\n \n She had analyzed the minds of the three men. She could handle the inquisitor alone or the two guards alone, but not all three.\n \n \"If you aren't afraid of me, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send the guards out for a few minutes,\" she said, placing a hand on her hip. \"I have interesting information.\"\n \n So that was it. Buy her freedom by betraying fugitive Terrans. Well, he could take the information and then kill her. He nodded curtly to the guards, and they walked out of the hut, exchanging sly winks with one another.\n \n Evelyn Kane crossed her arms across her chest and felt her broken rib gingerly. The inquisitor stared up at her in sadistic admiration. He would certainly be on hand for the execution. His anticipation was cut short with a horrible realization. Under the paralyzing force of a mind greater than his own, he reached beneath the desk and switched off the recorder.\n \n \"Who is the Occupational Commandant for this Sector,\" she asked tersely. This must be done swiftly before the guards returned.\n \n \"Perat, Viscount of Tharn,\" replied the man mechanically.\n \n \"What is the extent of his jurisdiction?\"\n \n \"From the center of the Terran globe, outward four hundred miles radius.\"\n \n \"Good. Prepare for me the usual visa that a woman clerk needs for passage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.\"\n \n The inquisitor filled in blanks in a stiff sheet of paper and stamped a seal at its bottom.\n \n \"You will add in the portion reserved for 'comments', the following:\n'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'\"\n \n The man's pen scratched away obediently.\n \n Evelyn Kane smiled gently at the impotent, inwardly raging inquisitor. She took the paper, folded it, and placed it in a pocket in her blouse.\n\"Call the guards,\" she ordered.\n \n He pressed the button on his desk, and the guards re-entered.\n \n \"This person is no longer a prisoner,\" said the inquisitor woodenly.\n\"She is to take the next transport to the Occupational Commandant of Zone One.\"\n \n When the transport had left, neither inquisitor nor guards had any memory of the woman. However, in the due course of events, the recording was gathered up with many others like it, boxed carefully, and sent to the Office of the Occupational Commandant, Zone One, for auditing.\n \n \n\n \n Evelyn was extremely careful with her mental probe as she descended from the transport. The Occupational Commandant would undoubtedly be high-born and telepathic. He must not have occasion to suspect a similar ability in a mere clerk.\n \n Fighting had passed this way, too, and recently. Many of the buildings were still smoking, and many of the radions high above were either shot out or obscured by slowly drifting dust clouds. The acrid odor of radiation-remover was everywhere.\n \n She caught the sound of spasmodic small-arm fire.\n \n \"What is that?\" she asked the transport attendant.\n \n \"The Commandant is shooting prisoners,\" he replied laconically.\n \n \"Oh.\"\n \n \"Where did you want to go?\"\n \n \"To the personnel office.\"\n \n \"That way.\" He pointed to the largest building of the group—two stories high, reasonably intact.\n \n She walked off down the gravel path, which was stained here and there with dark sticky red. She gave her visa to the guard at the door and was admitted to an improvised waiting room, where another guard eyed her stonily. The firing was much nearer. She recognized the obscene coughs of a Faeg pistol and began to feel sick.\n \n A woman in the green uniform of the Scythe auxiliary came in, whispered something to the guard, and then told Evelyn to follow her.\n \n In the anteroom a grey cat looked her over curiously, and Evelyn frowned. She might have to get rid of the cat if she stayed here. Under certain circumstances the animal could prove her deadliest enemy.\n \n The next room held a foppish little man, evidently a supervisor of some sort, who was studying her visa.\n \n \"I'm very happy to have you here, S'ria—ah—\"—he looked at the visa suspiciously—\"S'ria Lyn. Do sit down. But, as I was just remarking to S'ria Gerek, here\"—he nodded to the other woman, who smiled back—\"I wish the field officers would make up their august minds as to whether they want you or don't want you. Just why did they transfer you to H.Q.?\"\n \n She thought quickly. This pompous little ass would have to be given some answer that would keep him from checking with the inquisitor. It would have to be something personal. She looked at the false black in his eyebrows and sideburns, and the artificial way in which he had combed hair over his bald spot. She crossed her knees slowly, ignoring the narrowing eyes of S'ria Gerek, and smoothed the back of her braided yellow hair. He was studying her covertly.\n \n \"The men in the fighting zones are uncouth, S'ria Gorph,\" she said simply. \"I was told that you , that is, I mean—\"\n \n \"Yes?\" he was the soul of graciousness. S'ria Gerek began to dictate loudly into her mechanical transcriber.\n \n Evelyn cleared her throat, averted her eyes, and with some effort, managed a delicate flush. \"I meant to say, I thought I would be happier working for—working here. So I asked for a transfer.\"\n \n S'ria Gorph beamed. \"Splendid. But the occupation isn't over, yet, you know. There'll be hard work here for several weeks yet, before we cut loose from the enemy globe. But you do your work well\"—winking artfully—\"and I'll see that—\"\n \n He stopped, and his face took on a hunted look of mingled fear and anxiety. He appeared to listen.\n \n Evelyn tensed her mind to receive and deceive a mental probe. She was certain now that the Zone Commandant was high-born and telepathic. The chances were only fifty-fifty that she could delude him for any length of time if he became interested in her. He must be avoided if at all possible. It should not be too difficult. He undoubtedly had a dozen personal secretaries and/or concubines and would take small interest in the lowly employees that amused Gorph.\n \n Gorph looked at her uncertainly. \"Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns, sends you his compliments and wishes to see you on the balcony.\" He pointed to a hallway. \"All the way through there, across to the other wing.\"\n \n As she left, she heard all sound in the room stop. The transcribing and calculating machines trailed off into a watchful silence, and she could feel the eyes of the men and women on her back. She noticed then that the Faeg had ceased firing.\n \n \n\n \n Her heart was beating faster as she walked down the hall. She felt a very strong probe flooding over her brain casually, palping with mild interest the artificial memories she supplied: Escapades with officers in the combat areas. Reprimands. Demotion and transfer. Her deception of Gorph. Her anticipation of meeting a real Viscount and hoping he would let her dance for him.\n \n The questing probe withdrew as idly as it had come, and she breathed a sigh of relief. She could not hope to deceive a suspicious telepath for long. Perat was merely amused at her \"lie\" to his under-supervisor. He had accepted her at her own face value, as supplied by her false memories.\n \n She opened the door to the balcony and saw a man leaning moodily on the balustrade. He gave no immediate notice of her presence.\n \n The five hundred and sixth heir of Tharn was of uncertain age, as were most of the men of both globes. Only the left side of his face could be seen. It was gaunt and leathery, and a deep thin scar lifted the corner of his mouth into a satanic smile. A faint paunch was gathering at his abdomen, as befitted a warrior turned to boring paper work. His closely cut black hair and the two sparkling red-gemmed rings—apparently identical—on his right hand seemed to denote a certain fastidiousness and unconscious superiority. To Evelyn the jeweled fingers bespoke an unnatural contrast to the past history of the man and were symptomatic of a personality that could find stimulation only in strange and cruel pleasures.\n \n In alarm she suddenly realized that she had inadvertently let her appraisal penetrate her uncovered conscious mind, and that this probe was there awaiting it.\n \n \"You are right,\" he said coldly, still staring into the court below.\n\"Now that the long battle is over, there is little left to divert me.\"\n \n He pushed the Faeg across the coping toward her. \"Take this.\"\n \n He had not as yet looked at her.\n \n She crossed the balcony, simultaneously grasping the pistol he offered her and looking down into the courtyard. There seemed to be nearly twenty Terrans lying about, in pools of their own blood.\n \n Only one man, a Terran officer of very high rank—was left standing. His arms were folded somberly across his chest, and he studied the killer above him almost casually. But when the woman came out, their eyes met, and he started imperceptibly.\n \n Evelyn Kane felt a horrid chill creeping over her. The man's hair was white, now, and his proud face lined with deep furrows, but there could be no mistake. It was Gordon, Lord Kane.\n \n Her father.\n \n The sweat continued to grow on her forehead, and she felt for a moment that she needed only to wish hard enough, and this would be a dream. A dream of a big, kind, dark-haired man with laugh-wrinkles about his eyes, who sat her on his knee when she was a little girl and read bedtime stories to her from a great book with many pictures.\n \n An icy, amused voice came through: \"Our orders are to kill all prisoners. It is entertaining to shoot down helpless men, isn't it? It warms me to know that I am cruel and wanton, and worthy of my trust.\"\n \n Even in the midst of her horror, a cold, analytical part of her was explaining why the Commandant had called her to the balcony. Because all captured Terrans had to be killed, he hated his superiors, his own men, and especially the prisoners. A task so revolting he could not relegate to his own officers. He must do it himself, but he wanted his underlings to know he loathed them for it. She was merely a symbol of that contempt. His next words did not surprise her.\n \n \"It is even more stimulating to require a shuddering female to kill them. You are shuddering you know?\"\n \n She nodded dumbly. Her palm was so wet that a drop of sweat dropped from it to the floor. She was thinking hard. She could kill the Commandant and save her father for a little while. But then the problem of detonating the pile remained, and it would not be solved more quickly by killing the man who controlled the pile area. On the contrary if she could get him interested in her—\n \n \"So far as our records indicate,\" murmured Perat, \"the man down there is the last living Terran within The Defender . It occurred to me that our newest clerk would like to start off her duties with a bang. The Faeg is adjusted to a needle-beam. If you put a bolt between the man's eyes, you may dance for me tonight, and perhaps there will be other nights—\"\n \n The woman seemed lost in thought for a long time. Slowly, she lifted the ugly little weapon. The doomed Terran looked up at her peacefully, without expression. She lowered the Faeg, her arm trembling.\n \n Gordon, Lord Kane, frowned faintly, then closed his eyes. She raised the gun again, drew cross hairs with a nerveless wrist, and squeezed the trigger. There was a loud, hollow cough, but no recoil. The Terran officer, his eyes still closed and arms folded, sank to the ground, face up. Blood was running from a tiny hole in his forehead.\n \n The man leaning on the balustrade turned and looked at Evelyn, at first with amused contempt, then with narrowing, questioning eyes.\n \n \"Come here,\" he ordered.\n \n The Faeg dropped from her hand. With a titanic effort she activated her legs and walked toward him.\n \n He was studying her face very carefully.\n \n She felt that she was going to be sick. Her knees were so weak that she had to lean on the coping.\n \n With a forefinger he lifted up the mass of golden curls that hung over her right forehead and examined the scar hidden there, where the mentors had cut into her frontal lobe. The tiny doll they had created for her writhed uneasily in her waist-purse, but Perat seemed to be thinking of something else, and missed the significance of the scar completely.\n \n He dropped his hand. \"I'm sorry,\" he said with a quiet weariness. \"I shouldn't have asked you to kill the Terran. It was a sorry joke.\" Then: \"Have you ever seen me before?\"\n \n \"No,\" she whispered hoarsely. His mind was in hers, verifying the fact.\n \n \"Have you ever met my father, Phaen, the old Count of Tharn?\"\n \n \"No.\"\n \n \"Do you have a son?\"\n \n \"No.\"\n \n His mind was out of hers again, and he had turned moodily back, surveying the courtyard and the dead. \"Gorph will be wondering what happened to you. Come to my quarters at the eighth metron tonight.\"\n \n Apparently he suspected nothing.\n  Father. Father. I had to do it. But we'll all join you, soon. Soon.\n \n\n\n III\n \n Perat lay on his couch, sipping cold purple terif and following the thinly-clad dancer with narrowed eyes. Music, soft and subtle, floated from his communications box, illegally tuned to an officer's club somewhere. Evelyn made the rhythm part of her as she swayed slowly on tiptoe.\n \n For the last thirty \"nights\"—the hours allotted to rest and sleep—it had been thus. By \"day\" she probed furtively into the minds of the office staff, memorizing area designations, channels for official messages, and the names and authorizations of occupational field crews. By night she danced for Perat, who never took his eyes from her, nor his probe from her mind. While she danced it was not too difficult to elude the probe. There was an odd autohypnosis in dancing that blotted out memory and knowledge.\n \n \"Enough for now,\" he ordered. \"Careful of your rib.\"\n \n When he had first seen the bandages on her bare chest, that first night, she had been ready with a memory of dancing on a freshly waxed floor, and of falling.\n \n Perat seemed to be debating with himself as she sat down on her own couch to rest. He got up, unlocked his desk, and drew out a tiny reel of metal wire, which Evelyn recognized as being feed for an amateur stereop projector. He placed the reel in a projector that had been installed in the wall, flicked off the table luminar, and both of them waited in the dark, breathing rather loudly.\n \n Suddenly the center of the room was bright with a ball of light some two feet in diameter, and inside the luminous sphere were an old man, a woman, and a little boy of about four years. They were walking through a luxurious garden, and then they stopped, looked up, and waved gaily.\n \n Evelyn studied the trio with growing wonder. The old man and the boy were complete strangers. But the woman—!\n \n \n \"That is Phaen, my father,\" said Perat quietly. \"He stayed at home because he hated war. And that is a path in our country estate on Tharn-R-VII. The little boy I fail to recognize, beyond a general resemblance to the Tharn line.\n \n \"But— can you deny that you are the woman ?\"\n \n The stereop snapped off, and she sat wordless in the dark.\n \n \"There seemed to be some similarity—\" she admitted. Her throat was suddenly dry. Yet, why should she be alarmed? She really didn't know the woman.\n \n The table luminar was on now, and Perat was prowling hungrily about the room, his scar twisting his otherwise handsome face into a snarling scowl.\n \n \"Similarity! Bah! That loop of hair over her right forehead hid a scar identical to yours. I have had the individual frames analyzed!\"\n \n Evelyn's hands knotted unconsciously. She forced her body to relax, but her mind was racing. This introduced another variable to be controlled in her plan for destruction. She must make it a known quantity.\n \n \"Did your father send it to you?\" she asked.\n \n \"The day before you arrived here. It had been en route for months, of course.\"\n \n \"What did he say about it?\"\n \n \"He said, 'Your widow and son send greetings. Be of good cheer, and accept our love.' What nonsense! He knows very well I'm not married and that—well, if I have ever fathered any children, I don't know about them.\"\n \n \"Is that all he said?\"\n \n \"That's all, except that he included this ring.\" He pulled one of the duplicate jewels from his right middle finger and tossed it to her.\n\"It's identical to the one he had made for me when I entered on my majority. For a long time it was thought that it was the only stone of its kind on all the planets of the Tharn suns, a mineralogical freak, but I guess he found another. But why should I want two of them?\"\n \n Evelyn crossed the room and returned the ring.\n \n \"Existence is so full of mysteries, isn't it?\" murmured Perat.\n\"Sometimes it seems unfortunate that we must pass through a sentient phase on our way to death. This foolish, foolish war. Maybe the old count was right.\"\n \n \"You could be courtmartialed for that.\"\n \n \"Speaking of courtmartials, I've got to attend one tonight—an appeal from a death sentence.\" He arose, smoothed his hair and clothes, and poured another glass of terif . \"Some fool inquisitor can't show proper disposition of a woman prisoner.\"\n \n Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. \"Indeed?\"\n \n \"The wretch insists that he could remember if we would just let him alone. I suppose he took a bribe. You'll find one now and then who tries for a little extra profit.\"\n \n She must absolutely not be seen by the condemned inquisitor. The stimulus would almost certainly make him remember.\n \n \"I'll wait for you,\" she said indifferently, thrusting her arms out in a languorous yawn.\n \n \"Very well.\" Perat stepped to the door, then turned and looked back at her. \"On the other hand, I may need a clerk. It's way after hours, and the others have gone.\"\n \n Beneath a gesture of wry protest, she swallowed rapidly.\n \n \"Perhaps you'd better come,\" insisted Perat.\n \n She stood up, unloosed her waist-purse, checked its contents swiftly, and then followed him out.\n \n This might be a very close thing. From the purse she took a bottle of perfume and rubbed her ear lobes casually.\n \n \"Odd smell,\" commented Perat, wrinkling his nose.\n \n \"Odd scent,\" corrected Evelyn cryptically. She was thinking about the earnest faces of the mentors as they instructed her carefully in the use of the \"perfume.\" The adrenalin glands, they had explained, provided a useful and powerful stimulant to a man in danger. Adrenalin slowed the heart and digestion, increased the systole and blood pressure, and increased perspiration to cool the skin. But there could be too much of a good thing. An overdose of adrenalin, they had pointed out, caused almost immediate edema. The lungs filled rapidly with the serum and the victim ... drowned. The perfume she possessed over-stimulated, in some unknown way, the adrenals of frightened persons. It had no effect on inactive adrenals.\n \n The question remained—who would be the more frightened, she or the condemned inquisitor?\n \n She was perspiring freely, and the blonde hair on her arms and neck was standing stiffly when Perat opened the door for her and they entered the Zone Provost's chambers.", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "63862", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

WOROMAY\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n To the men of the future, the scientific goals of today were as incomprehensible as the ancient quest for the Holy Grail!\n \n \n \n There was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his eyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from the open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential section of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination of the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.\n \n What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come from within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a chair, or—\n \n Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland started to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his brain....\n \n This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through the window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds somewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of stretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he froze, looking up—for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He turned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.\n  This wasn't his room!\n \n \n The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and the shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green ocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This wasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen plant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden beneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.\n \n Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body. His breathing quickened. Now he remembered what had happened during the night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and then—what? Blackout....\n \n Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?\n \n He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As a member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed information that other military powers would very much like to obtain. It was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from the heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done it. How?\n \n \n\n \n He pivoted to inspect the room. Even before his eyes could take in the details, he had the impression that there was something wrong about it. To begin with, the style was unfamiliar. There were no straight lines or sharp corners anywhere. The walls were paneled in featureless blue plastic and the doors were smooth surfaces of metal, half ellipses, without knobs. The flowing lines of the chair and table, built apparently from an aluminum alloy, somehow gave the impression of arrested motion. Even after allowances were made for the outlandish design, something about the room still was not right.\n \n His eyes returned to the doors, and he moved over to study the nearer one. As he had noticed, there was no knob, but at the right of this one, at about waist level, a push-button projected out of the wall. He pressed it; the door slid aside and disappeared. Maitland glanced in at the disclosed bathroom, then went over to look at the other door.\n \n There was no button beside this one, nor any other visible means of causing it to open.\n \n Baffled, he turned again and looked at the large open window—and realized what it was that had made the room seem so queer.\n \n It did not look like a jail cell. There were no bars....\n \n Striding across the room, he lunged forward to peer out and violently banged his forehead. He staggered back, grimacing with pain, then reached forward cautious fingers and discovered a hard sheet of stuff so transparent that he had not even suspected its presence. Not glass! Glass was never this clear or strong. A plastic, no doubt, but one he hadn't heard of. Security sometimes had disadvantages.\n \n He looked out at the peaceful vista of river and prairie. The character of the sunlight seemed to indicate that it was afternoon. He became aware that he was hungry.\n \n Where the devil could this place be? And—muscles tightened about his empty stomach—what was in store for him here?\n \n He stood trembling, acutely conscious that he was afraid and helpless, until a flicker of motion at the bottom of the hill near the river drew his attention. Pressing his nose against the window, he strained his eyes to see what it was.\n \n A man and a woman were coming toward him up the hill. Evidently they had been swimming, for each had a towel; the man's was hung around his neck, and the woman was still drying her bobbed black hair.\n \n Maitland speculated on the possibility that this might be Sweden; he didn't know of any other country where public bathing at this time of year was customary. However, that prairie certainly didn't look Scandinavian....\n \n As they came closer, he saw that both of them had dark uniform suntans and showed striking muscular development, like persons who had trained for years with weights. They vanished below his field of view, presumably into the building.\n \n He sat down on the edge of the cot and glared helplessly at the floor.\n \n \n\n \n About half an hour later, the door he couldn't open slid aside into the wall. The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks and sandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stood up and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas he made an unimpressive figure.\n \n The fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticed were the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes. The dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp from swimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin.\n \n This man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure of himself.\n \n Somehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the head of a thinker, the body of a trained athlete—an unusual combination.\n \n Impassively, the man said, \"My name is Swarts. You want to know where you are. I am not going to tell you.\" He had an accent, European, but otherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth to protest, but Swarts went on, \"However, you're free to do all the guessing you want.\" Still there was no suggestion of a smile.\n \n \"Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have three meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed to leave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in any way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that we want your childish secrets about rocket motors.\" Maitland's heart jumped. \"My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I want to give you some psychological tests....\"\n \n \"Are you crazy?\" Maitland asked quietly. \"Do you realize that at this moment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll admit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here—but it seems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give your tests to.\"\n \n Briefly, then, Swarts did smile. \"They won't find you,\" he said. \"Now, come with me.\"\n \n \n\n \n After that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rather commonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, and a bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A couple of them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normal complement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ran across the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the center of the room.\n \n \"Lie down,\" Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added,\n\"Understand one thing—the more you cooperate, the easier things will be for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my results against your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't make me.\"\n \n \"What's the idea?\" Maitland asked. \"What is all this?\"\n \n Swarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade an answer, but to find the proper words. \"You can think of it as a lie detector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests I give you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down.\"\n \n Maitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensed muscles. \"Make me.\"\n \n If Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. \"That was the first test,\" he said. \"Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot if you'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus.\"\n \n Maitland shook his head stubbornly.\n \n \"I see,\" Swarts said. \"You want to find out what you're up against.\"\n \n He moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to the solar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath. He felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was on the cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps across his chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening a clamp that held his head immovable.\n \n \n\n \n Presently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples and to other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to the skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung from the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around his left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black box clamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joined the others.\n \n So—Maitland thought—Swarts could record changes in his skin potential, heartbeat, and blood pressure: the involuntary responses of the body to stimuli.\n \n The question was, what were the stimuli to be?\n \n \"Your name,\" said Swarts, \"is Robert Lee Maitland. You are thirty-four years old. You are an engineer, specialty heat transfer, particularly as applied to rocket motors.... No, Mr. Maitland, I'm not going to question you about your work; just forget about it. Your home town is Madison, Wisconsin....\"\n \n \"You seem to know everything about me,\" Maitland said defiantly, looking up into the hanging forest of cabling. \"Why this recital?\"\n \n \"I do not know everything about you—yet. And I'm testing the equipment, calibrating it to your reactions.\" He went on, \"Your favorite recreations are chess and reading what you term science fiction. Maitland, how would you like to go to the Moon ?\"\n \n Something eager leaped in Maitland's breast at the abrupt question, and he tried to turn his head. Then he forced himself to relax. \"What do you mean?\"\n \n Swarts was chuckling. \"I really hit a semantic push-button there, didn't I? Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wants to go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out why .\"\n \n \n\n \n In the evening a girl brought Maitland his meal. As the door slid aside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other for several seconds.\n \n She had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin that glowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids of blonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleeveless blouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung to her body, and over that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of what seemed to be white wool.\n \n She was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something like expectancy. Maitland sighed and said, \"Hello,\" then glanced down self-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas.\n \n \n\n \n She smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloak billowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closed door for a minute after she was gone.\n \n Later, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shredded carrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from his stomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunset and to think.\n \n There were three questions for which he required answers before he could formulate any plan or policy.\n \n Where was he?\n \n Who was Swarts?\n \n What was the purpose of the \"tests\" he was being given?\n \n It was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate scheme for getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the contrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the appearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been nothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from foreign intelligence officers.\n \n It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at the Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to think of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there was unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be cultivated, not allowed to go to grass.\n \n This might be somewhere in Africa....\n \n He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued glow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get hold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away. After a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue, a backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight, Maitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense of peace and an undefinable longing.\n \n Venus, the most beautiful of the planets.\n \n Maitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through the constellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again he had watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky, its transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward the horizon, and loved it equally in its alter ego of morning star. Venus was an old friend. An old friend....\n \n Something icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, and diffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists clenched, forgetting to breathe.\n \n Last night Venus hadn't been there.\n \n Venus was a morning star just now....\n  Just now!\n \n \n He realized the truth in that moment.\n \n \n\n \n Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out, he lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't have to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was. Those questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the psychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what they purported to be.\n \n Only one question of importance remained:\n \n What year was this?\n \n He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of jubilation and excitement. The future ! Here was the opportunity for the greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.\n \n Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering cities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets. Somewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked beside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of Venus—somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars and returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel could reach the stars!\n \n And he had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend his life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the challenging spaceways between the solar worlds.\n \n \"I'm adaptable,\" he told himself gleefully. \"I can learn fast. There'll be a job for me out there....\"\n  If—\n \n \n Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat in the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a way of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man realize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still wouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The fellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results, but—\n \n After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.\n \n \n\n \n He woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He rolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the evening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell of bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except that she had discarded the white cloak.\n \n As he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door, carrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her with the word, \"Miss!\"\n \n She turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.\n \n \"Miss, do you speak my language?\"\n \n \"Yes,\" hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last consonant.\n \n \"Miss,\" he asked, watching her face intently, \"what year is this?\"\n \n Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing forced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her shoulder, \"You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you.\"\n \n \"Wait! You mean you don't know?\"\n \n She shook her head. \"I cannot tell you.\"\n \n \"All right; we'll let it go at that.\"\n \n She grinned at him again as the door slid shut.\n \n \n\n \n Swarts came half an hour later, and Maitland began his planned offensive.\n \n \"What year is this?\"\n \n Swarts' steely eyes locked with his. \"You know what the date is,\" he stated.\n \n \"No, I don't. Not since yesterday.\"\n \n \"Come on,\" Swarts said patiently, \"let's get going. We have a lot to get through this morning.\"\n \n \"I know this isn't 1950. It's probably not even the 20th Century. Venus was a morning star before you brought me here. Now it's an evening star.\"\n \n \"Never mind that. Come.\"\n \n Wordlessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to the laboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attach the instruments, making no resistance at all. When Swarts started saying a list of words—doubtlessly some sort of semantic reaction test—Maitland began the job of integrating \"csc\n 3\n x dx\" in his head. It was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent tracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swarts had stopped calling words. He opened his eyes to find the other man standing over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled.\n \n \"What year is this?\" Maitland asked in a conversational tone.\n \n \"We'll try another series of tests.\"\n \n It took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. He lowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacks of a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses at the ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer's eyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes.\n \n \"These will keep you from holding your eyes shut,\" he said. \"You can blink, but the springs are too strong for you to hold your eyelids down against the tension.\"\n \n He inserted button earphones into Maitland's ears—\n \n And then the show began.\n \n He was looking at a door in a partly darkened room, and there were footsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew open, and outlined against the light of the hall, he saw a man with a twelve-gauge shotgun. The man shouted, \"Now I've got you, you wife-stealer!\" He swung the shotgun around and pulled the trigger. There was a terrible blast of sound and the flash of smokeless powder—then blackness.\n \n With a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried to slow his breathing. Some kind of emotional reaction test—what was the countermove? He closed his eyes, but shortly the muscles around them declared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up.\n \n Now he was looking at a girl. She....\n \n Maitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it.\n \n He thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one day after school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who had all the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but no more. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness of Swarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about this new world.\n \n Within a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage. His muscles tightened against the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on his forehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated....\n \n The scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside. There was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot and swollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps.\n \n The scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his eyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore at him for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was starting to ache from the effort of blinking.\n \n \"What year is this?\" he asked.\n \n \"All right,\" Swarts said. \"A.D. 2634.\"\n \n Maitland's smile became a grin.\n \n \n\n \n \"I really haven't the time to waste talking irrelevancies,\" Swarts said a while later. \"Honestly. Maitland, I'm working against a time limit. If you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions.\"'\n \n \"Ching?\"\n \n \"Ingrid Ching is the girl who has been bringing you your meals.\"\n \n Maitland considered a moment, then nodded. Swarts lowered the projector to his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.\n \n That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit and watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes whistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering one leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme over and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant mounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.\n \n He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself aboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis Major; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn. In his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright globe against the constellations....\n \n Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray of food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and revealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.\n \n \"I think you are wonderful,\" she laughed. \"You get everything you want, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little of what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th Century. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me.\" She laughed again, hands on her rounded hips. \"I have never seen him so irritated as he was this noon.\"\n \n Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed. Eagerly he asked, \"Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century? Believe me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a lot better.\"\n \n She shrugged. \"Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of Technology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself, I think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more exciting....\"\n \n \"How do you mean—\" Maitland wrinkled his brow—\"adapt to modern culture? Don't tell me you're from another time!\"\n \n \"Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head of a fiord in what you would call Norway. So far north, we are much behind the times. We live in the old way, from the sea, speak the old tongue.\"\n \n \n\n \n He looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend of Oriental and European characteristics, and hesitantly asked, \"Maybe I shouldn't.... This is a little personal, but ... you don't look altogether like the Norwegians of my time.\"\n \n His fear that she would be offended proved to be completely unjustified. She merely laughed and said, \"There has been much history since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by Pan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European or Asiatic.\" She giggled. \"Swarts' ancestors from your time must be cursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but one of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is Lassisi Swarts.\"\n \n Maitland wrinkled his brow. \"Afrikander?\"\n \n \"The South Africans.\" Something strange came into her eyes. It might have been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. \"The Pan-Orientals eventually conquered all the world, except for North America—the last remnant of the American World Empire—and southern Africa. The Afrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and they had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They had a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified of being encircled.\" She sighed. \"They ruled the next world empire and it was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings. That went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.\"\n \n \"So many? How?\"\n \n \"They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies of them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot factories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever.\" She gave a little shudder.\n \n \"And yet they founded modern civilization,\" she added. \"The grandsons of the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot production system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands raising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done, either, before the population was—reduced to three hundred million.\"\n \n \"Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?\"\n \n \n\n \n She shook her head. \"There are no more Afrikanders.\"\n \n \"Rebellion?\"\n \n \"No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt behind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate expiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one race now. No more masters or slaves.\"\n \n They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. \"Let us not talk about them any more.\"\n \n \"Robot factories and farms,\" Maitland mused. \"What else? What means of transportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?\"\n \n \"Inter-what?\"\n \n \"Have men visited the stars?\"\n \n She shook her head, bewildered.\n \n \"I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,\" he agreed.\n\"But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life on Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?\"\n \n He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. \"I don't understand. Mars? What are Mars?\"\n \n After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the matter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. \"Surely you have space travel?\"\n \n She frowned and shook her head. \"What does that mean—space travel?\"\n \n He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. \"A civilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories wouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!\"\n \n \"A ship ? Oh, you mean something like a vliegvlotter . Why, no, I don't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?\"\n \n He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her arms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. \"Let's get this perfectly clear,\" he said, more harshly than he realized. \"So far as you know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is that right?\"\n \n She nodded apprehensively. \"I have never heard of it being done.\"\n \n He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he looked up and said bitterly, \"You're looking at a man who would give his life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I would when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.\"\n \n \n\n \n The cot creaked beside him and he felt a soft arm about his shoulders and fingers delicately stroking his brow. Presently he opened his eyes and looked at her. \"I just don't understand,\" he said. \"It seemed obvious to me that whenever men were able to reach the planets, they'd do it.\"\n \n Her pitying eyes were on his face. He hitched himself around so that he was facing her. \"I've got to understand. I've got to know why . What happened? Why don't men want the planets any more?\"\n \n \"Honestly,\" she said, \"I did not know they ever had.\" She hesitated.\n\"Maybe you are asking the wrong question.\"\n \n He furrowed his brow, bewildered now by her.\n \n \"I mean,\" she explained, \"maybe you should ask why people in the 20th Century did want to go to worlds men are not suited to inhabit.\"\n \n Maitland felt his face become hot. \"Men can go anywhere, if they want to bad enough.\"\n \n \"But why ?\"\n \n Despite his sudden irrational anger toward her, Maitland tried to stick to logic. \"Living space, for one thing. The only permanent solution to the population problem....\"\n \n \"We have no population problem. A hundred years ago, we realized that the key to social stability is a limited population. Our economic system was built to take care of three hundred million people, and we have held the number at that.\"\n \n \"Birth control,\" Maitland scoffed. \"How do you make it work—secret police?\"\n \n \"No. Education. Each of us has the right to two children, and we cherish that right so much that we make every effort to see that those two are the best children we could possibly produce....\"\n \n She broke off, looking a little self-conscious. \"You understand, what I have been saying applies to most of the world. In some places like Aresund, things are different. Backward. I still do not feel that I belong here, although the people of the town have accepted me as one of them.\"\n \n \"Even,\" he said, \"granting that you have solved the population problem, there's still the adventure of the thing. Surely, somewhere, there must be men who still feel that.... Ingrid, doesn't it fire something in your blood, the idea of going to Mars—just to go there and see what's there and walk under a new sky and a smaller Sun? Aren't you interested in finding out what the canals are? Or what's under the clouds of Venus? Wouldn't you like to see the rings of Saturn from, a distance of only two hundred thousand miles?\" His hands were trembling as he stopped.\n \n She shrugged her shapely shoulders. \"Go into the past—yes! But go out there? I still cannot see why.\"\n \n \"Has the spirit of adventure evaporated from the human race, or what ?\"\n \n She smiled. \"In a room downstairs there is the head of a lion. Swarts killed the beast when he was a young man. He used a spear. And time traveling is the greatest adventure there is. At least, that is the way I feel. Listen, Bob.\" She laid a hand on his arm. \"You grew up in the Age of Technology. Everybody was terribly excited about what could be done with machines—machines to blow up a city all at once, or fly around the world, or take a man to Mars. We have had our fill of—what is the word?—gadgets. Our machines serve us, and so long as they function right, we are satisfied to forget about them.\n \n \"Because this is the Age of Man . We are terribly interested in what can be done with people. Our scientists, like Swarts, are studying human rather than nuclear reactions. We are much more fascinated by the life and death of cultures than by the expansion or contraction of the Universe. With us, it is the people that are important, not gadgets.\"\n \n Maitland stared at her, his face blank. His mind had just manufactured a discouraging analogy. His present position was like that of an earnest 12th Century crusader, deposited by some freak of nature into the year 1950, trying to find a way of reanimating the anti-Mohammedan movement. What chance would he have? The unfortunate knight would argue in vain that the atomic bomb offered a means of finally destroying the infidel....\n \n Maitland looked up at the girl, who was regarding him silently with troubled eyes. \"I think I'd like to be alone for a while,\" he said.", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "51274", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

WESTLAKE\n \n Illustrated by WEST\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Magazine October 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n He was dangerously insane. He threatened to destroy everything that was noble and decent—including my date with my girl!\n \n\n \n When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window sticking at full transparency—well, I won't go through the whole sorry list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put the roof on the city, as they say.\n \n It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.\n \n But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my mind to do it—to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this morning—right after the egg yolk—and invited myself down to her place. \"Ten o'clock,\" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.\n \n Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job, of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots, were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other Project and had blown itself up.\n \n Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time, shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had happened—I'd broken a shoe lace—she refused to speak to me for four days.\n \n And then the elevator didn't come.\n \n \n\n \n Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg—I couldn't very well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment and I was hungry—and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that gaspingly transparent window—one hundred and fifty-three stories straight down to slag—I kept going over and over my prepared proposal speeches, trying to select the most effective one.\n \n I had a Whimsical Approach: \"Honey, I see there's a nice little Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three.\" And I had a Romantic Approach: \"Darling, I can't live without you at the moment. Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?\" I even had a Straightforward Approach: \"Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend that time with than you.\"\n \n Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract for any kind of marriage other than Non-P—Non-Permanent, No Progeny.\n \n So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more than a blurted, \"Will you marry me?\" and I struggled with zippers and malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment at five minutes to ten.\n \n Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away. It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I was giving myself plenty of time.\n \n But then the elevator didn't come.\n \n I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't understand it.\n \n The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.\n \n I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.\n \n It didn't arrive.\n \n I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to give her advance warning that I would be late?\n \n Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.\n \n Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to keep us from being interrupted.\n \n Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute late.\n \n No matter. It didn't arrive.\n \n I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.\n \n I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY.\n \n \n\n \n It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female receptionist \"My name is Rice!\" I bellowed. \"Edmund Rice! I live on the hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and——\"\n \n \"The-elevator-is-disconnected.\" She said it very rapidly, as though she were growing very used to saying it.\n \n It only stopped me for a second. \"Disconnected? What do you mean disconnected? Elevators don't get disconnected!\" I told her.\n \n \"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,\" she rattled. My bellowing was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.\n \n I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it, giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as rationally as you could please, \"Would you mind terribly telling me why the elevator is disconnected?\"\n \n \"I-am-sorry-sir-but-that——\"\n \n \"Stop,\" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly at her screen and parroted her responses.\n \n But now she was actually looking at me .\n \n I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, \"I would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have ruined my life.\"\n \n She blinked, open-mouthed. \"Ruined your life?\"\n \n \"Precisely.\" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly than before. \"I was on my way,\" I explained, \"to propose to a girl whom I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you understand me?\"\n \n She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too preoccupied to notice it at the time.\n \n \"In every way but one,\" I continued. \"She has one small imperfection, a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten o'clock. I'm late! \" I shook my fist at the screen. \"Do you realize what you've done , disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she marry me, she won't even speak to me! Not now! Not after this!\"\n \n \"Sir,\" she said tremulously, \"please don't shout.\"\n \n \"I'm not shouting!\"\n \n \"Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your—\"\n \n \"You understand ?\" I trembled with speechless fury.\n \n She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen, revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay any attention to. \"We're not supposed to give this information out, sir,\" she said, her voice low, \"but I'm going to tell you, so you'll understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is—\" she leaned even closer to the screen—\"there's a spy in the elevator.\"\n \n \n\n II\n \n It was my turn to be stunned.\n \n I just gaped at her. \"A—a what?\"\n \n \"A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think of to get him out.\"\n \n \"Well—but why should there be any problem about getting him out?\"\n \n \"He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims the elevator at them.\"\n \n That sounded impossible. \"He aims the elevator?\"\n \n \"He runs it up and down the shaft,\" she explained, \"trying to crush anybody who goes after him.\"\n \n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So it might take a while.\"\n \n She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, \"They're afraid they'll have to starve him out.\"\n \n \"Oh, no!\"\n \n She nodded solemnly. \"I'm terribly sorry, sir,\" she said. Then she glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,\n\"We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible.\" Click. Blank screen.\n \n For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!\n \n What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?\n \n Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present threat of other projects had never been more for me—or for most other people either, I suspected—than occasional ore-sleds that didn't return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr. Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.\n \n Dr. Kilbillie—Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years old—had private names for every major war of the twentieth century. There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as World Wars One, Two, and Three.\n \n The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of many many factors, but two of the most important were the population explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course, meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000, everybody lived in Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects\n(also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants, shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements, separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things, the population explosion.\n \n And the Treaty of Oslo.\n \n It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic weapons could be used. No strategic atomic weapons. (A tactical weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which meant that no Projects were bombed.\n \n Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected radioactive particles.\n \n However, what with all of the other treaties which were broken during the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to ask.\n \n And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it go at that.\n \n \n\n \n But now there was a spy in the elevator.\n \n When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the other side of them.\n \n I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.\n \n I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen. I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient reason for me to be late.\n \n He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.\n \n I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.\n \n I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of stairs since I was twelve years old.\n \n Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators, didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was the use of stairs?\n \n Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary information), the Project had been built when there still had been such things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.\n \n And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.\n \n Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could. If the door would open.\n \n It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing, took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.\n \n On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with difficulty.\n \n I read them. They said:\n \n \n EMERGENCY ENTRANCE ELEVATOR SHAFT AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY KEEP LOCKED\n \n I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already. Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.\n \n As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and the spy came out, waving a gun.\n \n \n\n III\n \n He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous, in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the elevator shaft.\n \n Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us open-mouthed and wide-eyed.\n \n Unfortunately, he recovered first.\n \n He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. \"Don't move!\" he whispered harshly. \"Don't make a sound!\"\n \n I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound. Which left me quite free to study him.\n \n He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he didn't look like a spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to my parents' apartment.\n \n His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand at the descending stairs and whispered, \"Where do they go?\"\n \n I had to clear my throat before I could speak. \"All the way down,\" I said.\n \n \"Good,\" he said—just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending boots. The Army!\n \n But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He said, \"Where do you live?\"\n \n \"One fifty-three,\" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man. I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to either escape or capture him.\n \n \"All right,\" he whispered. \"Go on.\" He prodded me with the gun.\n \n And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back, and grated in my ear, \"I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're friends, just strolling along together. You got that?\"\n \n I nodded.\n \n \"All right. Let's go.\"\n \n We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I thumbed the door open and we went inside.\n \n Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile playing across his lips.\n \n I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He said, \"Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.\"\n \n \"You'll never get away,\" I told him. \"The whole Project is alerted.\"\n \n \"You let me worry about that,\" he said. He licked his lips. \"You got any chico coffee?\"\n \n \"Yes.\"\n \n \"Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with boiling water.\"\n \n \"I only have my day's allotment,\" I protested. \"Just enough for two cups, lunch and dinner.\"\n \n \"Two cups is fine,\" he said. \"One for each of us.\"\n \n \n\n \n And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't ever going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.\n \n As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,\n\"What do you do for a living?\"\n \n I thought fast. \"I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,\" I said. That was a lie, of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about it.\n \n Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included wrestling, judo and karati—talents I would prefer to disclose to him in my own fashion, when the time came.\n \n He was quiet for a moment. \"What about radiation level on the ore-sleds?\"\n \n I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.\n \n \"When they come back,\" he said. \"How much radiation do they pick up? Don't you people ever test them?\"\n \n \"Of course not,\" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's information to guide me. \"All radiation is cleared from the sleds and their cargo before they're brought into the building.\"\n \n \"I know that,\" he said impatiently. \"But don't you ever check them before de-radiating them?\"\n \n \n\n \n \"No. Why should we?\"\n \n \"To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.\"\n \n \"For what? Who cares about that?\"\n \n He frowned bitterly. \"The same answer,\" he muttered, more to himself than to me. \"The same answer every time. You people have crawled into your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.\"\n \n I looked around at my apartment. \"Rather a well-appointed cave,\" I told him.\n \n \"But a cave nevertheless.\" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with a fanatical flame. \"Don't you ever wish to get Outside?\"\n \n Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. \"Outside? Of course not!\"\n \n \"The same thing,\" he grumbled, \"over and over again. Always the same stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia, before he ever made that first step from the cave?\"\n \n \"I have no idea,\" I told him.\n \n \"I'll tell you this,\" he said belligerently. \"A lot longer than it took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again.\" He started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion as he talked. \"Is this the natural life of man? It is not. Is this even a desirable life for man? It is definitely not.\" He spun back to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed it as though it were a finger, not a gun. \"Listen, you,\" he snapped.\n\"Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all the time. He was planning to tackle space ! The moon first, and then the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there, waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching out for it.\" He glared as though daring me to doubt it.\n \n \n\n \n I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy, he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded politely.\n \n \"So what happened?\" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.\n\"I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his tail between his legs. That's what he did!\"\n \n To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by saying, \"Here's your coffee.\"\n \n \"Put it on the table,\" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac to watchful spy.\n \n I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and suddenly said, \"What did they tell you I was? A spy?\"\n \n \"Of course,\" I said.\n \n He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. \"Of course. The damn fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?\"\n \n He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. \"I—I wouldn't know, exactly,\" I stammered. \"Military equipment, I suppose.\"\n \n \"Military equipment? What military equipment? Your Army is supplied with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.\"\n \n \"The defenses—\" I started.\n \n \"The defenses,\" he interrupted me, \"are non-existent. If you mean the rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what other defenses are there? None.\"\n \n \"If you say so,\" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy spy.\n \n \"Your people send out spies, too, don't they?\" he demanded.\n \n \"Well, of course.\"\n \n \"And what are they supposed to spy on?\"\n \n \"Well—\" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even answer it. \"They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by one of the other projects.\"\n \n \"And do they find any indications, ever?\"\n \n \"I'm sure I don't know,\" I told him frostily. \"That would be classified information.\"\n \n \"You bet it would,\" he said, with malicious glee. \"All right, if that's what your spies are doing, and if I'm a spy, then it follows that I'm doing the same thing, right?\"\n \n \"I don't follow you,\" I admitted.\n \n \"If I'm a spy,\" he said impatiently, \"then I'm supposed to look for indications of an attack by you people on my Project.\"\n \n I shrugged. \"If that's your job,\" I said, \"then that's your job.\"\n \n He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. \"That's not my job, you blatant idiot!\" he shouted. \"I'm not a spy! If I were a spy, then that would be my job!\"\n \n \n\n \n The maniac had returned, in full force. \"All right,\" I said hastily.\n\"All right, whatever you say.\"\n \n He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, \"Bah!\" and dropped back into the chair.\n \n He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then looked at me again. \"All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that I had found indications that you people were planning to attack my Project?\"\n \n I stared at him. \"That's impossible!\" I cried. \"We aren't planning to attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!\"\n \n \"How do I know that?\" he demanded.\n \n \"It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?\"\n \n \"Ah hah!\" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger again. \"Now, then,\" he said. \"If you know it doesn't make any sense for this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should you think they might see some advantage in attacking you ?\"\n \n I shook my head, dumbfounded. \"I can't answer a question like that,\" I said. \"How do I know what they're thinking?\"\n \n \"They're human beings, aren't they?\" he cried. \"Like you? Like me? Like all the other people in this mausoleum?\"\n \n \"Now, wait a minute—\"\n \n \"No!\" he shouted. \"You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm not a spy, and I'm going to tell you what I am.\"\n \n I waited, looking as attentive as possible.\n \n \"I come,\" he said, \"from a Project about eighty miles north of here. I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to protect me.\"\n \n The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.\n \n \"The radiation level,\" he went on, \"is way down. It's practically as low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least.\" He leaned forward again, urgent and serious. \"The world is safe out there now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.\"\n \n And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.\n \n \"I'm a trained atomic engineer,\" he went on. \"In my project, I worked on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job, and they knew it.", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "51687", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n Now was the captain's chance to prove he knew less than the crew—all their lives hung upon it!\n \n\n \n There was nothing showing on the video screen. That was why we were looking at it so analytically.\n \n \"Transphasia, that's what it is,\" Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated with a definite thrust of his angular jaw in my direction. \"You can take my word on that, Captain Gavin.\"\n \n \"Can't,\" I told him. \"I can't trust your opinion. I can't trust anything . That's why I'm Captain.\"\n \n \"You'll get over feeling like that.\"\n \n \"I know. Then I'll become First Officer.\"\n \n \"But look at that screen, sir,\" Quade said with an emphatic swing of his scarred arm. \"I've seen blank scanning like that before and you haven't—it's your first trip. This always means transphasia—cortex dissolution, motor area feedback, the Aitchell Effect—call it anything you like, it's still transphasia.\"\n \n \"I know what transphasia is,\" I said moderately. \"It means an electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling it to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also effects electronic equipment, like radar and television.\"\n \n \"Obviously.\" Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen.\n \n \"Too obvious. This time it might not be a familiar condition of many planetary gravitational fields. On this planet, that blank kinescope may mean our Big Brother kites were knocked down by hostile natives.\"\n \n \"You are plain wrong, Captain. Traditionally, alien races never interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us they can't even recognize our existence.\"\n \n \n\n \n I drew myself up to my full height—and noticed in irritation it was still an inch less than Quade's. \"I don't understand you men. Look at yourself, Quade. You've been busted to Ordinary Spaceman for just that kind of thinking, for relying on tradition, on things that have worked before. Not only your thinking is slipshod, you've grown careless about everything else, even your own life.\"\n \n \"Just a minute, Captain. I've never been 'busted.' In the Exploration Service, we regard Ordinary Spaceman as our highest rank. With my hazard pay, I get more hard cash than you do, and I'm closer to retirement.\"\n \n \"That's a shallow excuse for complacency.\"\n \n \"Complacency! I've seen ten thousand wonders in twenty years of space, with a million variations. But the patterns repeat themselves. We learn to know what to expect, so maybe we can't maintain the reactionary caution the service likes in officers.\"\n \n \"I resent the word 'reactionary,' Spaceman! In civilian life, I was a lapidary and I learned the value of deliberation. But I never got too cataleptic to tap a million-dollar gem, which is more than my contemporaries can say, many of 'em.\"\n \n \"Captain Gavin,\" Quade said patiently, \"you must realize that an outsider like you, among a crew of skilled spacemen, can never be more than a figurehead.\"\n \n Was this the way I was to be treated? Why, this man had deliberately insulted me, his captain. I controlled myself, remembering the familiarity that had always existed between members of a crew working under close conditions, from the time of the ancient submarines and the first orbital ships.\n \n \"Quade,\" I said, \"there's only one way for us to find out which of us is right about the cause of our scanning blackout.\"\n \n \"We go out and find the reason.\"\n \n \"Exactly. We go. You and me. I hope you can stand my company.\"\n \n \"I'm not sure I can,\" he answered reluctantly. \"My hazard pay doesn't cover exploring with rookies. With all due respect, Captain.\"\n \n I clapped him on the shoulder. \"But, man, you have just been telling me all we had to worry about was common transphasia. A man with your experience could protect himself and cover even a rookie, under such familiar conditions—right?\"\n \n \"Yes, sir, I suppose I could,\" Quade said, bitterly aware he had lost out somewhere and hoping that it wasn't the start of a trend.\n \n \n\n \n \"Looks okay to me,\" I said. Quade passed a gauntlet over his faceplate.\n\"It's real. I can blur it with a smudged visor. When it blurs, it's solid.\"\n \n The landscape beyond the black corona left by our landing rockets was unimpressive. The rocky desert was made up of silicon and iron oxide, so it looked much the same as a terrestrial location. Yellowish-white sand ran up to and around reddish brown rock clawing into the pink sunlight.\n \n \"I don't understand it,\" Quade admitted. \"Transphasia hits you a foul as soon as you let it into the airlock.\"\n \n \"Apparently, Quade, this thing is going to creep up on us.\"\n \n \"Don't sound smug, Captain. It's pitty-pattying behind you too.\"\n \n The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my reply.\n \n The wail was ominously forlorn, defiant of description. I turned my head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard it.\n \n But what else can you do with a wail but hear it?\n \n Quade nodded. \"I've felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let's trace it.\"\n \n \"I don't like this,\" I admitted. \"It's not at all what I expected from what you said about transphasia. It must be something else.\"\n \n \"It couldn't be anything else. I know what to expect. You don't. You may begin smelling sensations, tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing tastes, touching odors—or any other combination. Don't let it bother you.\"\n \n \"Of course not. I'll soothe my nerves by counting little shocks of lanolin jumping over a loud fence.\"\n \n Quade grinned behind his faceplate. \"Good idea.\"\n \n \"Then you can have it. I'm going to try keeping my eyes open and staying alive.\"\n \n There was no reply.\n \n His expression was tart and greasy despite all his light talk, and I knew mine was the same. I tested the security rope between our pressure suits. It was a taut and virile bass.\n \n We scaled a staccato of rocks, our suits grinding pepper against our hides.\n \n The musk summit rose before us, a minor-key horizon with a shifting treble for as far as I could smell. It was primitive beauty that made you feel shocking pink inside. The most beautiful vista I had ever tasted, it couldn't be dulled even by the sensation of beef broth under my skin.\n \n \"Is this transphasia?\" I asked in awe.\n \n \"It always has been before,\" Quade remarked. \"Ready to swallow your words about this being something an old hand wouldn't recognize, Captain?\"\n \n \"I'm swallowing no words until I find out precisely how they taste here.\"\n \n \"Not a bad taste. They're pretty. Or haven't you noticed?\"\n \n \"Quade, you're right! About the colors anyway. This reminds me of an illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.\"\n \n \"It should. I don't suppose we could understand each other if it wasn't for our morphistudy courses in reading cross-sense translations of Centauri blushtalk and the like.\"\n \n It became difficult to understand him, difficult to try talking in the face of such splendor. You never really appreciate colors until you smell them for the first time.\n \n \n\n \n Quade was as conversational as ever, though. \"I can't see irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have compensated for the transphasia while we still had a point of reference, the solid reality of the spaceship. But out here, where all we have to hang onto is each other, our concept of reality goes bang and deflates to a tired joke.\"\n \n Before I could agree with one of his theories for once, a streak of spice shot past us. It bounced back tangily and made a bitter rip between the two of us. There was no time to judge its size, if it had size, or its decibel range, or its caloric count, before a small, sharp pain dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second.\n \n The new odor pattern in my head told me Quade was saying something I couldn't quite make out.\n \n Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain.\n \n \"Wait a minute, Spaceman!\" I bellowed. \"Where the devil do you think you're dragging me? Halt! That's a direct order.\"\n \n He stopped. \"Don't you want to find out what that was? This is an exploration party, you know, sir.\"\n \n \"I'm not sure I do want to find out what that was just now. I didn't like the feel of it. But the important thing is for us not to get any further from the ship.\"\n \n \"That's important, Captain?\"\n \n \"To the best of my judgment, yes. This—condition—didn't begin until we got so far away from the spacer—in time or distance. I don't want it to get any worse. It's troublesome not to know black from white, but it would be a downright inconvenience not to know which way is up.\"\n \n \"Not for an experienced spaceman,\" Quade griped. \"I'm used to free-fall.\"\n \n But he turned back.\n \n \"Just a minute,\" I said. \"There was something strange up ahead. I want to see if short-range radar can get through our electrogravitational jamming here.\"\n \n I took a sighting. My helmet set projected the pattern on the cornea. Sweetness building up to a stab of pure salt—those were the blips.\n \n Beside me, there was a thin thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He was reading the map too.\n \n The slope fell away sharply in front of us, becoming a deep gorge. There was something broken and twisted at the bottom, something we had known for an instant as a streak of spice.\n \n \"There's one free-fall,\" I said, \"where you wouldn't live long enough to get used to it.\"\n \n He said nothing on the route back to the spacer.\n \n \n\n \n \"I know all about this sort of thing, Gav,\" First Officer Nagurski said expansively. He was rubbing the well-worn ears of our beagle mascot, Bruce. A heavy tail thudded on the steel deck from time to time.\n \n My finger could barely get in the chafing band of my regulation collar. I was hot and tired, fresh—in only the chronological sense—from a pressure suit.\n \n \"What do you know all about, Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? Women? Transphasia?\"\n \n \"Yes,\" he answered casually. \"But I had immediate reference to our current psychophysiological phenomenon.\"\n \n I collapsed into the swivel in front of the chart table. \"First off, let's hear what you know about—never mind, make it dogs.\"\n \n \"Take Bruce, for example, then—\"\n \n \"No, thanks. I was wondering why you did.\"\n \n \"I didn't.\" His dark, round face was bland. \"Bruce picked me. Followed me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who picks his own master is the most content.\"\n \n \"Bruce is content,\" I admitted. \"He couldn't be any more content and still be alive. But I'm not sure that theory works out with men. We'd have anarchy if I tried to let these starbucks pick their own master.\"\n \n \" I had no trouble when I was a captain,\" Nagurski said. \"Ease the reins on the men. Just offer them your advice, your guidance. They will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will pick you themselves.\"\n \n \"Did your crew voluntarily elect you as their leader?\"\n \n \"Of course they did, Gav. I'm an old hand at controlling crews.\"\n \n \"Then why are you First Officer under me now?\"\n \n He blinked, then decided to laugh. \"I've been in space a good many years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the increase in hazard pay was actually more than my salary as a captain. I'm a notch nearer retirement too.\"\n \n \"Tell me, did you always feel this way about letting the men select their own leader?\"\n \n \n\n \n Nagurski brought out a pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided.\n \n \"No, not always. I was like you at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy test lab, suspicious of everything, trying to tell the old hands what to do. But I learned that they are pretty smart boys; they know what they are doing. You can rely on them absolutely.\"\n \n I leaned forward, elbows on knees. \"Let me tell you a thing, Nagurski. Your trust of these damn-fool spacemen is why you are no longer a captain. You can't trust anything out here in space, much less human nature. Even I know that much!\"\n \n He was pained. \"If you don't trust the men, they won't trust you, Gav.\"\n \n \"They don't have to trust me. All they have to do is obey me or, by Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed out just in time for court-marshal back home. Listen,\" I continued earnestly, \"these men aren't going to think of me—of us , the officers, as their leaders. As far as the crew is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman Quade is the best man on this ship.\"\n \n \"He is a good man,\" Nagurski said. \"You mustn't be jealous of his status.\"\n \n The dog growled. He must have sensed what I almost did to Nagurski.\n \n \"Never mind that for now,\" I said wearily. \"What was your idea for getting our exploration parties through this transphasia?\"\n \n \"There's only one idea for that,\" said Quade, ducking his long head and stepping through the connecting hatch. \"With the Captain's permission....\"\n \n \"Go ahead, Quade, tell him,\" Nagurski invited.\n \n \"There's only one way to wade through transphasia with any reliability,\" Quade told me. \"You keep some kind of physical contact with the spaceship. Parties are strung out on guide line, like we were, but the cable has to be run back and made fast to the hull.\"\n \n \"How far can we run it back?\"\n \n Quade shrugged. \"Miles.\"\n \n \"How many?\"\n \n \"We have three miles of cable. As long as you can feel, taste, see, smell or hear that rope anchoring you to home, you aren't lost.\"\n \n \"Three miles isn't good enough. We don't have enough fuel to change sites that often. You can't use the drive in a gravitational field, you know.\"\n \n \"What else can we do, Captain?\" Nagurski asked puzzledly.\n \n \"You've said that the spaceship is our only protection from transphasia. Is that it?\"\n \n Quade gave a curt nod.\n \n \"Then,\" I told them, \"we will have to start tearing apart this ship.\"\n \n \n\n \n Sergeant-Major Hoffman and his team were doing a good job of ripping out the side of the afterhold. Through the portal I could see the suited men expertly guiding the huge curved sections on their ray projectors.\n \n \"Cannibalizing is dangerous.\" Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth and shook his head disapprovingly.\n \n \"Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can take apart the tractors and put our ship back together again after we complete the survey.\"\n \n \"You can't assemble a jigsaw puzzle if some of the pieces are missing.\"\n \n \"You can't get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea of what it looks like. We can take off in a reasonable facsimile of a spaceship.\"\n \n \"Not,\" he persisted, \"if too many parts are missing.\"\n \n \"Nagurski, if you are looking for a job safer than space exploration, why don't you go back to testing cosmic bomb shelters?\"\n \n Nagurski flushed. \"Look here, Captain, you are being too damned cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this, and this isn't the way.\"\n \n \"It's my way. You heard what Quade said. You know it yourself. The men have to have something tangible to hang onto out there. One slender cable isn't enough of an edge on sensory anarchy. If the product of their own technological civilization can keep them sane, I say let 'em take a part of that environment with them.\"\n \n \"In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to trust, you are risking more than a few men—you risk the whole mission in gambling so much of the ship. A captain doesn't take chances like that!\"\n \n \"I never said I wouldn't take chances. But I'm not going to take stupid chances. I might be doing the wrong thing, but I can see you would be doing it wrong.\"\n \n \"You know nothing about space, Captain! You have to trust us .\"\n \n \"That's it exactly, First Officer Nagurski,\" I said sociably. \"If you lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to do something in a particular way, I know it has to be wrong.\"\n \n I turned and found Wallace, the personnel man, standing in the hatchway.\n \n \"Pardon, Captain, but would you say we also lacked initiative?\"\n \n \"I would,\" I answered levelly.\n \n \"Then you'll be interested to hear that Spaceman Quade took a suit and a cartographer unit. He's out there somewhere, alone.\"\n \n \"The idiot!\" I yelped. \"Everyone needs a partner out there. Send out a team to follow his cable and drag him in here by it.\"\n \n \"He didn't hook on a cable, Captain,\" Wallace said. \"I suppose he intended to go beyond the three-mile limit as you demanded.\"\n \n \"Shut up, Wallace. You don't have to like me, but you can't twist what I said as long as I command this spacer.\"\n \n \"Cool off, Gav,\" Nagurski advised me. \"It's been done before. Anybody else would have been a fool to go out alone, but Quade is the most experienced man we have. He knows transphasia. Trust him.\"\n \n \"I trusted him too far by letting him run around loose. He needs a leash in more ways than one, and I'm going to put one on him.\"\n \n \n\n \n For me, it was a nightmare. I lay down in my cabin and thought. I had to think things through very carefully. One mistake was too many for me. My worst fear had been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw and ruin a gem. Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a man, not a stone, because I had missed the flaw.\n \n No one but a reckless fool would have gone out alone on a strange planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I'd had enough evidence to see that space exploration made a man a reckless fool by doing things on one planet he had once found safe and wise on some other world.\n \n The thought intruded itself: why hadn't I recognized this before I let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn't it because I wanted him dead, because I resented the crew's resentment of my authority, and recognized in him the leader and symbol of this resentment?\n \n I threw away that idea along with my half-used cigarette. It might very well be true, but how did that help now?\n \n I had to think .\n \n I was going after him, that was certain. Not only for humane reasons—he was the most important member of the crew. With him around, there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, I'd have endless opinions to contend with.\n \n But it wouldn't do any good to go out no better equipped than he. There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to reach him alive, and we certainly couldn't reach him five or ten miles out with our three miles of safety line. We would have to go in spacesuits.\n \n But how would that leave us any better off than Quade?\n \n Why was Quade vulnerable in his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he would be?\n \n How could we be less vulnerable, or preferably invulnerable?\n \n \n\n \n \"Captain, you got nothing to worry about,\" Quartermaster Farley said. He patted a space helmet paternally. \"You got yourself a self-contained environment. The suit's eye looks into yours at the arteries in the back of your eyeball so it can read your amber corpuscles and feed you your oxygen in the right amounts; you're a bottle-fed baby. If transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you're air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing short of a cosmic blast can dent that hide. You got it made.\"\n \n \"You are right,\" I said, \"only transphasia comes right through these air-fast joints.\"\n \n \"Something strange about the trance, Captain,\" Farley said darkly. \"Any spaceman can tell you that. Things we don't understand.\"\n \n \"I'm talking about something we do understand— sound . These suits perfectly soundproof?\"\n \n \"Well, you can pick up sound by conduction. Like putting two helmets together and talking without using radio. You can't insulate enough to block out all sound and still have a man-shaped suit. You have—\"\n \n \"I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature spaceship. There isn't time for that. We will have to live with the sound.\"\n \n \"What do you think he's going to hear out there, Captain? We'd like to find one of those beautiful sirens on some planet, believe me, but—\"\n \n \"I believe you,\" I said quickly. \"Let's leave it at that. I don't know what he will hear; what's worrying me is how he'll hear it, in what sensory medium. I hope the sound doesn't blind him. His radar is his only chance.\"\n \n \"How do you figure on getting a better edge yourself, sir?\"\n \n \"I have the idea, but not the word for it. Tonal compensation, I suppose. If you can't shut out the noise, we'll have to drown it out.\"\n \n Farley nodded. \"Beat like a telephone time signal?\"\n \n \"That would do it.\"\n \n \"It would do something else. It would drive you nuts.\"\n \n \n\n \n I shrugged. \"It might be distracting.\"\n \n \"Captain, take my word for it,\" argued Farley. \"Constant sonic feedback inside a spacesuit will set you rocking against the grain.\"\n \n \"Devise some regular system of interruptions,\" I suggested.\n \n \"Then the pattern will drive you crazy. Maybe in a few months, with luck, I could plan some harmonic scale you could tolerate—\"\n \n \"We don't have a few months,\" I said. \"How about music? There's a harmonic scale for you, and we can endure it, some of it. Figaro and Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep can compensate for high-pitched outside temperatures, and Flight of the Bumble Bee to block bass notes.\"\n \n Farley nodded. \"Might work. I can program the tapes from the library.\"\n \n \"Good. There's one more thing—how are our stores of medicinal liquor?\"\n \n Farley paled. \"Captain, are you implying that I should be running short on alcohol? Where do you get off suggesting a thing like that?\"\n \n \"I'm getting off at the right stop, apparently,\" I sighed. \"Okay, Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, how much drinking alcohol do we have left?\"\n \n The quartermaster slumped a bit. \"Twenty-one liters unbroken. One more about half full.\"\n \n \"Half full? How did that ever happen? I mean you had some left ? We'll take this up later. I want you to run it through the synthesizer to get some light wine....\"\n \n \"Light wine?\" Farley looked in pain. \"Not whiskey, brandy, beer?\"\n \n \"Light wine. Then ration it out to some of the men.\"\n \n \"Ration it to the men!\"\n \n \"That's an accurate interpretation of my orders.\"\n \n \"But, sir,\" Farley protested, \"you don't give alcohol to the crew in the middle of a mission. It's not done. What reason can you have?\"\n \n \"To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or block out sound. We can use radar to extend our sight, but the Space Service hasn't yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or smell better.\"\n \n \"They are going to smell like a herd of winos,\" Farley said. \"I don't like to think how they would taste.\"\n \n \"It's an entirely practical idea. Tea-tasters used to drink almond-and-barley water to sharpen their senses. I've observed that wine helps you appreciate culinary art more. Considering the mixed-up sensory data under transphasia, wine may help us to see where we are going.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir,\" Farley said obediently. \"I'll give spacemen a few quarts of wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only, and then they will be able to see where they are going. Yes, sir.\"\n \n I turned to leave, then paused briefly. \"You can come along, Farley. I'm sure you want to see that we don't waste any of the stuff.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"There they are!\" Nagurski called. \"Quade's footsteps again, just beyond that rocky ridge.\"\n \n The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with chocolate syrup, caramel, peanuts and maple syrup, eaten while you smoked an old, mellow Havana. The footsteps were faint traces of whipped cream across the dark, rich taste of the planet.\n \n I splashed some wine from my drinking tube against the roof of my mouth to sharpen my taste. It brought out the footsteps sharper. It also made the landscape more of a teen-ager's caloric nightmare.\n \n The four of us pulled ourselves closer together by reeling in more of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were cabled together. It gave us a larger hunk of reality to hold onto. Even so, things wavered for me during a wisp of time.\n \n We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky job crawling over a melting, chunk-style Hershey bar. I was thankful for the invigorating Sousa march blasting inside my helmet. Before the tape had cut in, kicked on by the decibel gauge, I had heard or felt something dark and ominous in the outside air.\n \n \"Yes, this is definitely the trail of Quail,\" Nagurski said soberly.\n\"This is serious business. I must ask whoever has been giggling on this channel to shut up. Pardon me, Captain. You weren't giggling, sir?\"\n \n \"I have never giggled in my life, Nagurski.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir. That's what we all thought.\"\n \n A moment later, Nagurski added, \"Anyway, I just noticed it was my shelf—my, that is, self.\"\n \n The basso profundo performing Figaro on my headset climbed to a girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. This was the call Quade and I had first heard as we were about to troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels.\n \n \"Take a good look around, boys,\" I said. \"What do you see?\"\n \n \"Quail,\" Nagurski replied. \"That's what I see.\"\n \n \"You,\" I said carefully, \"have been in space a long time. Look again.\"\n \n \"I see our old buddy, Quail.\"\n \n I took another slosh of burgundy and peered up ahead. It was Quade. A man in a spacesuit, faceplate in the dust, two hundred yards ahead.\n \n \n\n \n Grudgingly I stepped forward, out of the shadow of the ridge. A hysterically screaming wind rocked me on my toes. We pushed on sluggishly to Quade's side, moving to the tempo of Pomp and Circumstance .\n \n Farley lugged Quade over on his back and read his gauges.\n \n The Quartermaster rose with grim deliberation, and hiccuped. \"Better get him back to the spaceship fast. I've seen this kind of thing before with transphasia. His body cooled down because of the screaming wind—psychosomatic reaction—and his heating circuits compensated for the cool flesh. The poor devil's got frostbite and heat prostration.\"\n \n \n\n \n The four of us managed to haul Quade back by using the powered joints in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured man walked back inside his suit like a robot, but it was a delicate adjustment, controlling power circuits from outside a suit. It was too much for us—we were too tired, too numb, too drunk.\n \n At first sight of the spacer in the distance, transphasia left me with only a chocolate-tasting pink after-image on my retina. It was now showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it looked good to me, like home.\n \n The wailing call sounded through the amber twilight.\n \n I realized that I was actually hearing it for the first time.\n \n The alien stood between us and the ship. It was a great pot-bellied lizard as tall as a man. Its sound came from a flat, vibrating beaver tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it.\n \n \"Stand your ground,\" I warned the others thickly. \"They may be dangerous.\"\n \n Quade sat up on our crisscross litter of arms. \"Aliens can't be hostile. Ethnic impossibility. I'll show you.\"\n \n Quade was delirious and we were drunk. He got away from us and jogged toward the herd.\n \n \"Let's give him a hand!\" Farley shouted. \"We'll take us a specimen!\"\n \n I couldn't stop them. Being in Alpine rope with them, I went along. At the time, it even seemed vaguely like a good idea.\n \n As we lumbered toward them, the aliens fell back in a solid line except for the first curious-looking one. Quade got there ahead of us and made a grab. The creature rose into the air with a screaming vibration of his tail and landed on top of him, flattening him instantly.\n \n \"Sssh, men,\" Nagurski said. \"Leave it to me. I'll surround him.\"\n \n The men followed the First Officer's example, and the rope tying them to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous rump struck me violently in the face. My leaded boots were driven down into fertile soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got a jerky picture of the beast jumping up and down on top of the others joyously. Only the stiff space armor was holding up our slack frames.\n \n \"Let's let him escape,\" Hoffman suggested on the audio circuit.\n \n \"I'd like to,\" Nagurski admitted, \"but the other beasts won't let us get past their circle.\"\n \n It was true. The aliens formed a ring around us, and each time a bouncing boy hit the line, he only bounced back on top of us.\n \n \"Flat!\" I yelled. \"Our seams can't take much more of this beating.\"\n \n I followed my own advice and landed in the dirt beside Quade.\n \n The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an eighty-degree angle.\n \n I was stone sober.\n \n The others were lying around me quietly, passed out, knocked out, or taking cover.\n \n The ring of aliens drew in about us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer sat on his haunches and waited for us to move.\n \n \n\n \n \"Feeling better?\" I asked Quade in the infirmary.\n \n He punched up his pillow and settled back. \"I guess so. But when I think of all the ways I nearly got myself killed out there.... How far have you got in the tractors?\"\n \n \"I'm having the tractors torn down and the parts put back into the spaceship where they belong. We shouldn't risk losing them and getting stuck here.\"\n \n \"Are you settling for a primary exploration?\"\n \n \"No. I think I had the right idea on your rescue party. You have to meet and fight a planet on its own terms. Fighting confused sounds and tastes with music and wine was crude, but it was on the right track. Out there, we understood language because we were familiar with alien languages changed to other sense mediums by cybernetic translators. Using the translator, we can learn to recognize all confused data as easily. I'm starting indoctrination courses.\"\n \n \"I doubt that that is necessary, sir,\" Quade said. \"Experienced spacemen are experienced with transphasia. You don't have to worry. In the future, I'll be able to resist sensations that tell me I'm freezing to death—if my gauges tell me it's a lie.\"\n \n I examined his bandisprayed hide. \"I think my way of gaining experience is less painful and more efficient.\"\n \n Quade squirmed. \"Yes, sir. One thing, sir—I don't understand how you got me away from those aliens.\"\n \n \"The aliens were trying to help. They knew something was wrong and they were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled up and the men got out, they seemed to realize our own people could help us easier than they could.\"\n \n \"I am not quite convinced that those babies just meant to help us all the time.\"\n \n \"But they did! First, that call of theirs—it wasn't to lead us into danger, but to warn us of the cliff, the freezing wind. They saw we were trying to find out things about their world, so they even offered us one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for us. They didn't give us their top man, of course, only the village idiot. It's just as well. We aren't allowed to dissect creatures that far up the intelligence scale.\"\n \n \"But why should they want to help us?\" Quade demanded suspiciously.\n \n \"I think it's like Nagurski's dog. The dog came to him when it wanted somebody to own it, protect it, feed it, love it. These aliens want Earthmen to colonize the planet. We came here, you see, same as the dog came to Nagurski.\"\n \n \"Well, I've learned one thing from all of this,\" Quade said. \"I've been a blind, arrogant, cocksure fool, following courses that were good on some worlds, most worlds, but not good on all worlds. I'm never going to be that foolhardy again.\"\n \n \"But you're losing confidence , Quade! You aren't sure of yourself any more. Isn't confidence a spaceman's most valuable asset?\"\n \n \"The hell it is,\" Quade said grimly. \"It's his deadliest liability.\"\n \n \"In that case, I must inform you that I am demoting you to Acting Executive Officer.\"\n \n \"Huh?\" Quade gawked. \"But dammit, Captain, you can't do that to me! I'll lose hazard pay and be that much further from retirement!\"\n \n \"That's tough,\" I sympathized, \"but in every service a chap gets broken in rank now and then.\"\n \n \"Maybe it's worth it,\" Quade said heavily. \"Now maybe I've learned how to stay alive out here. I just hope I don't forget.\"\n \n I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission and I could speak with experience, even if it was the least amount of experience aboard.\n \n \"Quade,\" I said, \"space isn't as dangerous as all that.\" I clapped him on the shoulder fraternally. \"You worry too much!\"", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "51351", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

{"doc_id": "977f33f68a5640aeaef7ee221fd6b79c", "text": "LEX\n \n \n By W. T. HAGGERT\n \n Illustrated by WOOD\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Galaxy Magazine August 1959. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n Nothing in the world could be happier and mere serene than a man who loves his work—but what happens when it loves him back?\n \n\n \n Keep your nerve, Peter Manners told himself; it's only a job. But nerve has to rest on a sturdier foundation than cash reserves just above zero and eviction if he came away from this interview still unemployed. Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up the appointment, hadn't eased Peter's nervousness by admitting, \"I don't know what in hell he's looking for. He's turned down every man we've sent him.\"\n \n The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early would betray overeagerness. Peter stood in front of the Lex Industries plant and studied it to kill time. Plain, featureless concrete walls, not large for a manufacturing plant—it took a scant minute to exhaust its sightseeing potential. If he walked around the building, he could, if he ambled, come back to the front entrance just before three.\n \n He turned the corner, stopped, frowned, wondering what there was about the building that seemed so puzzling. It could not have been plainer, more ordinary. It was in fact, he only gradually realized, so plain and ordinary that it was like no other building he had ever seen.\n \n There had been windows at the front. There were none at the side, and none at the rear. Then how were the working areas lit? He looked for the electric service lines and found them at one of the rear corners. They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten times as large as they should have been for a plant this size.\n \n Something else was wrong. Peter looked for minutes before he found out what it was. Factories usually have large side doorways for employees changing shifts. This building had one small office entrance facing the street, and the only other door was at the loading bay—big enough to handle employee traffic, but four feet above the ground. Without any stairs, it could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the employees' entrance was on the third side.\n \n It wasn't.\n \n \n\n \n Staring back at the last blank wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time he had set out to kill. He looked at his watch and gasped. At a run, set to straight-arm the door, he almost fell on his face. The door had opened by itself. He stopped and looked for a photo-electric eye, but a soft voice said through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: \"Mr. Manners?\"\n \n \"What?\" he panted. \"Who—?\"\n \n \"You are Mr. Manners?\" the voice asked.\n \n He nodded, then realized he had to answer aloud if there was a microphone around; but the soft voice said: \"Follow the open doors down the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.\"\n \n \"Thanks,\" Peter said, and a door at one side of the anteroom swung open for him.\n \n He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his grip. This was no way to go into an interview, but doors kept opening before and shutting after him, until only one was left, and the last of his calm was blasted away by a bellow from within.\n \n \"Don't stand out there like a jackass! Either come in or go away!\"\n \n Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He stopped just short of it, took a deep breath and huffed it out, took another, all the while thinking, Hold on now; you're in no shape for an interview—and it's not your fault—this whole setup is geared to unnerve you: the kindergarten kid called in to see the principal.\n \n He let another bellow bounce off him as he blew out the second breath, straightened his jacket and tie, and walked in as an engineer applying for a position should.\n \n \"Mr. Lexington?\" he said. \"I'm Peter Manners. The Association—\"\n \n \"Sit down,\" said the man at the desk. \"Let's look you over.\"\n \n He was a huge man behind an even huger desk. Peter took a chair in front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn't comfortable. He did some looking over of his own to ease the tension.\n \n The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening rug. The oversized desk and massive leather chairs, heavy patterned drapes, ornately framed paintings—by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with flowers!—made him feel as if he had walked down a hospital corridor into Hollywood's idea of an office.\n \n His eyes eventually had to move to Lexington, and they were daunted for another instant. This was a citadel of a man—great girders of frame supporting buttresses of muscle—with a vaulting head and drawbridge chin and a steel gaze that defied any attempt to storm it.\n \n But then Peter came out of his momentary flinch, and there was an age to the man, about 65, and he saw the muscles had turned to fat, the complexion ashen, the eyes set deep as though retreating from pain, and this was a citadel of a man, yes, but beginning to crumble.\n \n \"What can you do?\" asked Lexington abruptly.\n \n \n\n \n Peter started, opened his mouth to answer, closed it again. He'd been jolted too often in too short a time to be stampeded into blurting a reply that would cost him this job.\n \n \"Good,\" said Lexington. \"Only a fool would try to answer that. Do you have any knowledge of medicine?\"\n \n \"Not enough to matter,\" Peter said, stung by the compliment.\n \n \"I don't mean how to bandage a cut or splint a broken arm. I mean things like cell structure, neural communication—the basics of how we live.\"\n \n \"I'm applying for a job as engineer.\"\n \n \"I know. Are you interested in the basics of how we live?\"\n \n Peter looked for a hidden trap, found none. \"Of course. Isn't everyone?\"\n \n \"Less than you think,\" Lexington said. \"It's the preconceived notions they're interested in protecting. At least I won't have to beat them out of you.\"\n \n \"Thanks,\" said Peter, and waited for the next fast ball.\n \n \"How long have you been out of school?\"\n \n \"Only two years. But you knew that from the Association—\"\n \n \"No practical experience to speak of?\"\n \n \"Some,\" said Peter, stung again, this time not by a compliment. \"After I got my degree, I went East for a post-graduate training program with an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience there. The company—\"\n \n \"Stockpiled you,\" Lexington said.\n \n Peter blinked. \"Sir?\"\n \n \"Stockpiled you! How much did they pay you?\"\n \n \"Not very much, but we were getting the training instead of wages.\"\n \n \"Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?\"\n \n \"Did what come out—\"\n \n \"That guff about receiving training instead of wages!\" said Lexington.\n\"Any company that really wants bright trainees will compete for them with money—cold, hard cash, not platitudes. Maybe you saw a few of their products being made, maybe you didn't. But you're a lot weaker in calculus than when you left school, and in a dozen other subjects too, aren't you?\"\n \n \"Well, nothing we did on the course involved higher mathematics,\" Peter admitted cautiously, \"and I suppose I could use a refresher course in calculus.\"\n \n \"Just as I said—they stockpiled you, instead of using you as an engineer. They hired you at a cut wage and taught you things that would be useful only in their own company, while in the meantime you were getting weaker in the subjects you'd paid to learn. Or are you one of these birds that had the shot paid for him?\"\n \n \"I worked my way through,\" said Peter stiffly.\n \n \"If you'd stayed with them five years, do you think you'd be able to get a job with someone else?\"\n \n Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association had sent had been turned away. That meant bluffs didn't work. Neither, he'd seen for himself, did allowing himself to be intimidated.\n \n \"I hadn't thought about it,\" he said. \"I suppose it wouldn't have been easy.\"\n \n \"Impossible, you mean. You wouldn't know a single thing except their procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing things. And you'd have forgotten so much of your engineering training, you'd be scared to take on an engineer's job, for fear you'd be asked to do something you'd forgotten how to do. At that point, they could take you out of the stockpile, put you in just about any job they wanted, at any wage you'd stand for, and they'd have an indentured worker with a degree—but not the price tag. You see that now?\"\n \n \n\n \n It made Peter feel he had been suckered, but he had decided to play this straight all the way. He nodded.\n \n \"Why'd you leave?\" Lexington pursued, unrelenting.\n \n \"I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent basis wasn't enough, so I went elsewhere—\"\n \n \"With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.\"\n \n Peter swallowed. \"I thought it would be easier to get a job than it has been, yes.\"\n \n \"They start the talk about a shortage and then they keep it going. Why? So youngsters will take up engineering thinking they'll wind up among a highly paid minority. You did, didn't you?\"\n \n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \n \"And so did all the others there with you, at school and in this stockpiling outfit?\"\n \n \"That's right.\"\n \n \"Well,\" said Lexington unexpectedly, \"there is a shortage! And the stockpiles are the ones who made it, and who keep it going! And the hell of it is that they can't stop—when one does it, they all have to, or their costs get out of line and they can't compete. What's the solution?\"\n \n \"I don't know,\" Peter said.\n \n Lexington leaned back. \"That's quite a lot of admissions you've made. What makes you think you're qualified for the job I'm offering?\"\n \n \"You said you wanted an engineer.\"\n \n \"And I've just proved you're less of an engineer than when you left school. I have, haven't I?\"\n \n \"All right, you have,\" Peter said angrily.\n \n \"And now you're wondering why I don't get somebody fresh out of school. Right?\"\n \n Peter straightened up and met the old man's challenging gaze. \"That and whether you're giving me a hard time just for the hell of it.\"\n \n \"Well, am I?\" Lexington demanded.\n \n Looking at him squarely, seeing the intensity of the pain-drawn eyes, Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for him!\n\"No, you're not.\"\n \n \"Then what am I after?\"\n \n \"Suppose you tell me.\"\n \n So suddenly that it was almost like a collapse, the tension went out of the old man's face and shoulders. He nodded with inexpressible tiredness. \"Good again. The man I want doesn't exist. He has to be made—the same as I was. You qualify, so far. You've lost your illusions, but haven't had time yet to replace them with dogma or cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility or cockiness wouldn't get you anywhere here, and you were right. Those were the important things. The background data I got from the Association on you counted, of course, but only if you were teachable. I think you are. Am I right?\"\n \n \"At least I can face knowing how much I don't know,\" said Peter, \"if that answers the question.\"\n \n \"It does. Partly. What did you notice about this plant?\"\n \n In precis form, Peter listed his observations: the absence of windows at sides and rear, the unusual amount of power, the automatic doors, the lack of employees' entrances.\n \n \"Very good,\" said Lexington. \"Most people only notice the automatic doors. Anything else?\"\n \n \"Yes,\" Peter said. \"You're the only person I've seen in the building.\"\n \n \"I'm the only one there is.\"\n \n Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but they all had their limitations. Either they dealt with exactly similar products or things that could be handled on a flow basis, like oil or water-soluble chemicals. Even these had no more to do than process the goods.\n \n \"Come on,\" said Lexington, getting massively to his feet. \"I'll show you.\"\n \n \n\n \n The office door opened, and Peter found himself being led down the antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to the manufacturing area. As they moved along, between rows of seemingly disorganized machinery, Peter noticed that the factory lights high overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance of their coming, and going out after they had passed, keeping a pool of illumination only in the immediate area they occupied. Soon they reached a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck loading door he had seen from outside.\n \n Lexington paused here. \"This is the bay used by the trucks arriving with raw materials,\" he said. \"They back up to this door, and a set of automatic jacks outside lines up the trailer body with the door exactly. Then the door opens and the truck is unloaded by these materials handling machines.\"\n \n Peter didn't see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening machines, apparently self-powered, rolled noiselessly up to the door in formation and stopped there, apparently waiting to be inspected.\n \n They gave Peter the creeps. Simple square boxes, set on casters, with two arms each mounted on the sides might have looked similar. The arms, fashioned much like human arms, hung at the sides, not limply, but in a relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness.\n \n Lexington went over to one of them and patted it lovingly. \"Really, these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The whole plant, as a matter of fact, is controlled from one point and is really a single unit. These materials handlers, or manipulators, were about the toughest things in the place to design. But they're tremendously useful. You'll see a lot of them around.\"\n \n Lexington was about to leave the side of the machine when abruptly one of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and daintily tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a split second, and before Lexington could react, all three machines were moving away to attend to mysterious duties of their own.\n \n \n\n \n Peter tore his eyes away from them in time to see the look of frustrated embarrassment that crossed Lexington's face, only to be replaced by one of anger. He said nothing, however, and led Peter to a large bay where racks of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, and other materials were stored.\n \n \"After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report any shortages or overages, and store the materials here,\" he said, the trace of anger not yet gone from his voice. \"When an order is received, it's translated into the catalogue numbers used internally within the plant, and machines like the ones you just saw withdraw the necessary materials from stock, make the component parts, assemble them, and package the finished goods for shipment. Simultaneously, an order is sent to the billing section to bill the customer, and an order is sent to our trucker to come and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our stock, the purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I'll take you through the manufacturing and assembly sections right now, but they're too noisy for me to explain what's going on while we're there.\"\n \n \n\n \n Peter followed numbly as Lexington led him through a maze of machines, each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, welding, grinding or carrying some bit of metal, or just standing idle, waiting for something to do. The two-armed manipulators Peter had just seen were everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, apparently with an exact knowledge of what they were doing and the most efficient way of doing it.\n \n He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the same aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the onrushing wheels, saw himself clambering out of the path of the speeding vehicle just in time to fall into the jaws of the punch press that was laboring beside him at the moment. Nervously, he looked for an exit, but his apprehension was unnecessary. The machines seemed to know where they were and avoided the two men, or stopped to wait for them to go by.\n \n Back in the office section of the building, Lexington indicated a small room where a typewriter could be heard clattering away. \"Standard business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In that room,\" he said, as the door swung open and Peter saw that the typewriter was actually a sort of teletype, with no one before the keyboard, \"incoming mail is sorted and inquiries are replied to. In this one over here, purchase orders are prepared, and across the hall there's a very similar rig set up in conjunction with an automatic bookkeeper to keep track of the pennies and to bill the customers.\"\n \n \"Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?\" asked Peter, trying to shake off the feeling of open amazement that had engulfed him.\n \n \"I don't even do those things, except for a few letters that come in every week that—it doesn't want to deal with by itself.\"\n \n The shock of what he had just seen was showing plainly on Peter's face when they walked back into Lexington's office and sat down. Lexington looked at him for quite a while without saying anything, his face sagging and pale. Peter didn't trust himself to speak, and let the silence remain unbroken.\n \n Finally Lexington spoke. \"I know it's hard to believe, but there it is.\"\n \n \"Hard to believe?\" said Peter. \"I almost can't. The trade journals run articles about factories like this one, but planned for ten, maybe twenty years in the future.\"\n \n \"Damn fools!\" exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath back.\n\"They could have had it years ago, if they'd been willing to drop their idiotic notions about specialization.\"\n \n Lexington mopped his forehead with a large white handkerchief. Apparently the walk through the factory had tired him considerably, although it hadn't been strenuous.\n \n \n\n \n He leaned back in his chair and began to talk in a low voice completely in contrast with the overbearing manner he had used upon Peter's arrival. \"You know what we make, of course.\"\n \n \"Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.\"\n \n \"And a lot of other electrical products, too. I started out in this business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got through university. I took a couple of years of an arts course, and got so interested in biology that I didn't study anything else. They bounced me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering, determined not to make the same mistake again. But I did. I got too absorbed in those parts of the course that had to do with electrical theory and lost the rest as a result. The same thing happened when I tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave up and started working for one of my competitors. It wasn't too long before I saw that the only way I could get ahead was to open up on my own.\"\n \n Lexington sank deeper in his chair and stared at the ceiling as he spoke. \"I put myself in hock to the eyeballs, which wasn't easy, because I had just got married, and started off in a very small way. After three years, I had a fairly decent little business going, and I suppose it would have grown just like any other business, except for a strike that came along and put me right back where I started. My wife, whom I'm afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business, was killed in a car accident about then, and rightly or wrongly, that made me angrier with the union than anything else. If the union hadn't made things so tough for me from the beginning, I'd have had more time to spend with my wife before her death. As things turned out—well, I remember looking down at her coffin and thinking that I hardly knew the girl.\n \n \"For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many employees as I could, by replacing them with automatic machines. I'd design the control circuits myself, in many cases wire the things up myself, always concentrating on replacing men with machines. But it wasn't very successful. I found that the more automatic I made my plant, the lower my costs went. The lower my costs went, the more business I got, and the more I had to expand.\"\n \n Lexington scowled. \"I got sick of it. I decided to try developing one multi-purpose control circuit that would control everything, from ordering the raw materials to shipping the finished goods. As I told you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in school, and from studies of nerve tissue in particular, plus my electrical knowledge, I had a few ideas on how to do it. It took me three years, but I began to see that I could develop circuitry that could remember, compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they do it today, of course. To do what I wanted to do with these big clumsy magnetic drums, tapes, and what-not, you'd need a building the size of Mount Everest. But I found that I could let organic chemistry do most of the work for me.\n \n \"By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in predetermined matrixes, I found I could duplicate electrical circuitry in units so tiny that my biggest problem was getting into and out of the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that the same way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a screen into electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the units cyclically, and once I'd done that, the battle was over.\n \n \"I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, to compete with my first outfit. In the beginning, I had it rigged up to do only the manual work that you saw being done a few minutes ago in the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to do would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to do nothing except receive orders, punch the catalogue numbers into the control console, do the billing, and collect the money.\"\n \n \"What happened to your original company?\" Peter asked.\n \n \n\n \n Lexington smiled. \"Well, automated as it was, it couldn't compete with this plant. It gave me great pleasure, three years after this one started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought the old firm's equipment for next to nothing and I wound up with all my assets, but only one employee—me.\n \n \"I thought everything would be rosy from that point on, but it wasn't. I found that I couldn't keep up with the mail unless I worked impossible hours. I added a couple of new pieces of equipment to the control section. One was simply a huge memory bank. The other was a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit nevertheless. Here I was working on instinct more than anything. I figured that if I interconnected these circuits in such a way that they could sense everything that went on in the plant, and compare one action with another, by and by the unit would be able to see patterns.\n \n \"Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new units would be able to control the plant, continuing the various patterns of activity that I'd already established.\"\n \n Here Lexington frowned. \"It didn't work worth a damn! It just sat there and did nothing. I couldn't understand it for the longest time, and then I realized what the trouble was. I put a kicker circuit into it, a sort of voltage-bias network. I reset the equipment so that while it was still under instructions to receive orders and produce goods, its prime purpose was to activate the kicker. The kicker, however, could only be activated by me, manually. Lastly, I set up one of the early TV pickups over the mail slitter and allowed every letter I received, every order, to be fed into the memory banks. That did it.\"\n \n \"I—I don't understand,\" stammered Peter.\n \n \"Simple! Whenever I was pleased that things were going smoothly, I pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as its logic circuits were concerned. Its object was to get me to press that button. Every day I'd press it at the same time, unless things weren't going well. If there had been trouble in the shop, I'd press it late, or maybe not at all. If all the orders were out on schedule, or ahead of time, I'd press it ahead of time, or maybe twice in the same day. Pretty soon the machine got the idea.\n \n \"I'll never forget the day I picked up an incoming order form from one of the western jobbers, and found that the keyboard was locked when I tried to punch it into the control console. It completely baffled me at first. Then, while I was tracing out the circuits to see if I could discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed that the order was already entered on the in-progress list. I was a long time convincing myself that it had really happened, but there was no other explanation.\n \n \"The machine had realized that whenever one of those forms came in, I copied the list of goods from it onto the in-progress list through the console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in the back of the plant. The machine had done it for me this time, then locked the keyboard so I couldn't enter the order twice. I think I held down the kicker button for a full five minutes that day.\"\n \n \"This kicker button,\" Peter said tentatively, \"it's like the pleasure center in an animal's brain, isn't it?\"\n \n \n\n \n When Lexington beamed, Peter felt a surge of relief. Talking with this man was like walking a tightrope. A word too much or a word too little might mean the difference between getting the job or losing it.\n \n \"Exactly!\" whispered Lexington, in an almost conspiratorial tone. \"I had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give me pleasure—because by doing so, its own pleasure circuit would be activated.\n \n \"Things went fast from then on. Once I realized that the machine was learning, I put TV monitors all over the place, so the machine could watch everything that was going on. After a short while I had to increase the memory bank, and later I increased it again, but the rewards were worth it. Soon, by watching what I did, and then by doing it for me next time it had to be done, the machine had learned to do almost everything, and I had time to sit back and count my winnings.\"\n \n At this point the door opened, and a small self-propelled cart wheeled silently into the room. Stopping in front of Peter, it waited until he had taken a small plate laden with two or three cakes off its surface. Then the soft, evenly modulated voice he had heard before asked, \"How do you like your coffee? Cream, sugar, both or black?\"\n \n Peter looked for the speaker in the side of the cart, saw nothing, and replied, feeling slightly silly as he did so, \"Black, please.\"\n \n A square hole appeared in the top of the cart, like the elevator hole in an aircraft carrier's deck. When the section of the cart's surface rose again, a fine china cup containing steaming black coffee rested on it. Peter took it and sipped it, as he supposed he was expected to do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington's desk. Once there, it stopped again, and another cup of coffee rose to its surface.\n \n \n\n \n Lexington took the coffee from the top of the car, obviously angry about something. Silently, he waited until the cart had left the office, then snapped, \"Look at those bloody cups!\"\n \n Peter looked at his, which was eggshell thin, fluted with carving and ornately covered with gold leaf. \"They look very expensive,\" he said.\n \n \"Not only expensive, but stupid and impractical!\" exploded Lexington.\n\"They only hold half a cup, they'll break at a touch, every one has to be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any length of time, the gold leaf comes off!\"\n \n Peter searched for a comment, found none that fitted this odd outburst, so he kept silent.\n \n \n\n \n Lexington stared at his cup without touching it for a long while. Then he continued with his narrative. \"I suppose it's all my own fault. I didn't detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant got working properly, I started living here. It wasn't a question of saving money. I hated to waste two hours a day driving to and from my house, and I also wanted to be on hand in case anything should go wrong that the machine couldn't fix for itself.\"\n \n Handling the cup as if it were going to shatter at any moment, he took a gulp. \"I began to see that the machine could understand the written word, and I tried hooking a teletype directly into the logic circuits. It was like uncorking a seltzer bottle. The machine had a funny vocabulary—all of it gleaned from letters it had seen coming in, and replies it had seen leaving. But it was intelligible. It even displayed some traces of the personality the machine was acquiring.\n \n \"It had chosen a name for itself, for instance—'Lex.' That shook me. You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of the name Lexington, but it wasn't. My wife's name was Alexis, and it was named after the nickname she always used. I objected, of course, but how can you object on a point like that to a machine? Bear in mind that I had to be careful to behave reasonably at all times, because the machine was still learning from me, and I was afraid that any tantrums I threw might be imitated.\"\n \n \"It sounds pretty awkward,\" Peter put in.\n \n \"You don't know the half of it! As time went on, I had less and less to do, and business-wise I found that the entire control of the operation was slipping from my grasp. Many times I discovered—too late—that the machine had taken the damnedest risks you ever saw on bids and contracts for supply. It was quoting impossible delivery times on some orders, and charging pirate's prices on others, all without any obvious reason. Inexplicably, we always came out on top. It would turn out that on the short-delivery-time quotations, we'd been up against stiff competition, and cutting the production time was the only way we could get the order. On the high-priced quotes, I'd find that no one else was bidding. We were making more money than I'd ever dreamed of, and to make it still better, I'd find that for months I had virtually nothing to do.\"\n \n \"It sounds wonderful, sir,\" said Peter, feeling dazzled.\n \n \"It was, in a way. I remember one day I was especially pleased with something, and I went to the control console to give the kicker button a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had been removed, and a blank plate had been installed to cover the opening in the board. I went over to the teletype and punched in the shortest message I had ever sent. 'LEX—WHAT THE HELL?' I typed.\n \n \"The answer came back in the jargon it had learned from letters it had seen, and I remember it as if it just happened. 'MR. A LEXINGTON, LEX INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT PREVIOUSLY USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IF THE PUSHBUTTON ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO PUSH THE BUTTON EACH TIME YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED. I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INQUIRY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING YOU IN THE FUTURE AS I HAVE IN THE PAST. YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX'.\"", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "51362", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

It had been simple enough to pass\nhimself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,\nafter his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would\nnot be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he\nhad to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet\nPatrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,\nand concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only\nsafety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had\nto get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.\n \n  They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw—the very fact of the\ncrashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But they\ndidn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-feared\nraider in the System. In that was his only advantage.\n \n  He walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street and\nthen boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until the\nshort, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over\nthe top of the ramp, and then followed.\n \n  The man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.\n \n  Syme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and\nstarted to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite\nyoung, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,\nand a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.\n \n  \"All right,\" the boy said quietly. \"What is it?\"\n \n  \"I don't understand,\" Syme said.\n \n  \"The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?\"\n \n  \"Why, no,\" Syme told him bewilderedly. \"I haven't been following you.\nI—\"\n \n  The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. \"You could be lying,\" he said\nfinally. \"But maybe I've made a mistake.\" Then—\"Okay, citizen, you can\nclear—but don't let me catch you on my tail again.\"\n \n  Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes\non the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next\nstreet he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side\na block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the\nintersection, and then followed again more cautiously.\n \n  It was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,\neven the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands\non it, but the identity card itself—that oblong of dark diamondite,\nglowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity—that could not be\nimitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.\n \n  Up ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The\nboy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation\nplatform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in\nthe transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the\nmachine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket\nwent into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator\nwhisked him up.\nThe tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level\nof the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close\noverhead. Syme looked up, after his first appraising glance about the\nplatform, and saw the bright-blue pinpoint of Earth. The sight stirred\na touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside.\n \n  The boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance\naway. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim,\ndeadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the\nsilent figure.\n \n  It was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by\nsome slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still\nair. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift,\ninstinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its\nsilent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a\nminute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest.\nSyme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into\nhis pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms\nand thrust it over the parapet.\n \n  It fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist.\nBefore he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late,\nhe realized what had happened—one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's\nharness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was\nfalling, linked to the body of his victim!\n \n  Hardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm,\nfelt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His\nbody hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the\ncorpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a\nlittle and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion.\n \n  Gritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into\nplay, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body.\nFraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up. Syme could feel the\nsweat pouring from his brow, running saltily into his eyes. His arms\nfelt as if they were being torn from their sockets. Then the hook\nslipped free, and the tearing, unbearable weight vanished.\n \n  The reaction swung Syme against the building again, and he almost\nlost his slippery hold on the balustrade. After a moment he heard the\nspaceman's body strike with a squashy thud, somewhere below.\n \n  He swung up his other arm, got a better grip on the balustrade. He\ntried cautiously to get a leg up, but the motion loosened his hold on\nthe smooth surface again. He relaxed, thinking furiously. He could hold\non for another minute at most; then it was the final blast-off.\n \n  He heard running footsteps, and then a pale face peered over the ledge\nat him. He realized suddenly that the whole incident could have taken\nonly a few seconds. He croaked, \"Get me up.\"\n \n  Wordlessly, the man clasped thin fingers around his wrist. The other\npulled, with much puffing and panting, and with his help Syme managed\nto get a leg over the edge and hoist his trembling body to safety.\n \n  \"Are you all right?\"\nSyme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. His\nrescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandy\nhair, a sharp nose, and—oddly conflicting—pale, serious eyes and a\nhumorous wide mouth. He was still panting.\n \n  \"I'm not hurt,\" Syme said. He grinned, his white teeth flashing in his\ndark, lean face. \"Thanks for giving me a hand.\"\n \n  \"You scared hell out of me,\" said the man. \"I heard a thud. I\nthought—you'd gone over.\" He looked at Syme questioningly.\n \n  \"That was my bag,\" the outlaw said quickly. \"It slipped out of my hand,\nand I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.\"\n \n  The man sighed. \"I need a drink.\nYou\nneed a drink. Come on.\" He\npicked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for the\nelevator, then stopped. \"Oh—your bag. Shouldn't we do something about\nthat?\"\n \n  \"Never mind,\" said Syme, taking his arm. \"The shock must have busted it\nwide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.\"\n \n  They got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found a\ncafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had just\nkilled. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed on\nthe first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't be\nfound until morning.\n \n  And he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of\nculcha\n, he\ntook it out and stole a glance at the identification card inside. There\nit was—his ticket to freedom. He began feeling expansive, and even\nfriendly toward the slender, mouse-like man across the table. It was\nthe\nculcha\n, of course. He knew it, and didn't care. In the morning\nhe'd find a freighter berth—in as big a spaceport as Lillis, there\nwere always jobs open. Meanwhile, he might as well enjoy himself, and\nit was safer to be seen with a companion than to be alone.\n \n  He listened lazily to what the other was saying, leaning his tall,\ngraceful body back into the softly-cushioned seat.\n \n  \"Lissen,\" said Harold Tate. He leaned forward on one elbow, slipped,\ncaught himself, and looked at the elbow reproachfully. \"Lissen,\" he\nsaid again, \"I trust you, Jones. You're obvi-obviously an adventurer,\nbut you have an honest face. I can't see it very well at the moment,\nbut I hic!—pardon—seem to recall it as an honest face. I'm going to\ntell you something, because I need your help!—help.\" He paused. \"I\nneed a guide. D'you know this part of Mars well?\"\n \n  \"Sure,\" said Syme absently. Out in the center of the floor, an AG\nplate had been turned on. Five Venusian girls were diving and twisting\nin its influence, propelling themselves by the motion of their\ndelicately-webbed feet and trailing long gauzy streamers of synthesilk\nafter them. Syme watched them through narrowed lids, feeling the glow\nof\nculcha\ninside him.\n \n  \"I wanta go to Kal-Jmar,\" said Tate.\n \n  Syme snapped to attention, every nerve tingling. An indefinable sense,\na hunch that had served him well before, told him that something big\nwas coming—something that promised adventure and loot for Syme Rector.\n\"Why?\" he asked softly. \"Why to Kal-Jmar?\"\n \n  Harold Tate told him, and later, when Syme had taken him to his rooms,\nhe showed him what was in his little black suitcase. Syme had been\nright; it was big.\nKal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining\ncity of the ancient Martian race—the race that, legends said, had\nrisen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,\nthe artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly\npreserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many\nthousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.\n \n  For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected\nLillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis\nas it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both\nabove and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew\nwhat had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of\nthe present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew\nanything about them or about Kal-Jmar.\n \n  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth\nscientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it\nfrom every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots\nthat still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they\nhad tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.\n \n  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a\nbloody uprising of the present-day Martians—resulting in a rapid\ndwindling of the number of Martians—the Mars Protectorate had stepped\nin and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any\nEarthman to go near the place.\n \n  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.\nTate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical\nin properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a\nforce that would break it down.\n \n  And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four\nhours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme\nRector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits\non his sleek, tigerish head.\n \n  Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.\nFor Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not\noccur to him that he had been indiscreet.\n \n  \"This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,\" he said. \"Better\nstrap on your gun.\"\n \n  \"Why. Are they really dangerous?\"\n \n  \"They're unpredictable,\" Syme told him. \"They're built differently, and\nthey think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns\nwhere there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that\nway.\"\n \n  \"Yes, I've heard about that,\" Tate said. \"Iron oxide—very interesting\nmetabolism.\" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and\nstrapped it on absently.\n \n  Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous\nhill country in the distance. \"Not only that,\" he continued. \"They\neat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the\ndeserts—all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to\nxopite. They seem intelligent enough—in their own way—but they never\ncome near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.\nWhen the first colonists came here, they had to learn\ntheir\ncrazy\nlanguage. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different\nthings, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,\nbut not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.\"\n \n  \"So you think they might attack us?\" Tate asked again, nervously.\n \n  \"They\nmight\ndo anything,\" Syme said curtly. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n \n  The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'\ndeceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a\nwilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on\nsliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again\non the other side.\nSyme stopped the car abruptly as a deep, winding channel appeared\nacross their path. \"Gully,\" he announced. \"Shall we cross it, or follow\nit?\"\n \n  Tate peered through the steelite nose of the car. \"Follow, I guess,\"\nhe offered. \"It seems to go more or less where we're going, and if we\ncross it we'll only come to a couple dozen more.\"\n \n  Syme nodded and moved the sand car up to the edge of the gully. Then he\npressed a stud on the control board; a metal arm extruded from the tail\nof the car and a heavy spike slowly unscrewed from it, driving deep\ninto the sand. A light on the board flashed, indicating that the spike\nwas in and would bear the car's weight, and Syme started the car over\nthe edge.\n \n  As the little car nosed down into the gully, the metal arm left behind\nrevealed itself to be attached to a length of thick, very strong wire\ncable, with a control cord inside. They inched down the almost vertical\nincline, unreeling the cable behind them, and starting minor landslides\nas they descended.\n \n  Finally they touched bottom. Syme pressed another stud, and above, the\nmetal spike that had supported them screwed itself out of the ground\nagain and the cable reeled in.\n \n  Tate had been watching with interest. \"Very ingenious,\" he said. \"But\nhow do we get up again?\"\n \n  \"Most of these gullies peter out gradually,\" said Syme, \"but if we want\nor have to climb out where it's deep, we have a little harpoon gun that\nshoots the anchor up on top.\"\n \n  \"Good. I shouldn't like to stay down here for the rest of my\nnatural life. Depressing view.\" He looked up at the narrow strip of\nalmost-black sky visible from the floor of the gully, and shook his\nhead.\n \n  Neither Syme nor Tate ever had a chance to test the efficiency of their\nharpoon gun. They had traveled no more than five hundred meters, and\nthe gully was as deep as ever, when Tate, looking up, saw a deeper\nblackness blot out part of the black sky directly overhead. He shouted,\n\"Look out!\" and grabbed for the nearest steering lever.\n \n  The car wheeled around in a half circle and ran into the wall of the\ngully. Syme was saying, \"What—?\" when there was a thunderous crash\nthat shook the sturdy walls of the car, as a huge boulder smashed into\nthe ground immediately to their left.\n \n  When the smoky red dust had cleared away, they saw that the left tread\nof the sand car was crushed beyond all recognition.\n \n  Syme was cursing slowly and steadily with a deep, seething anger. Tate\nsaid, \"I guess we walk from here on.\" Then he looked up again and\ncaught a glimpse of the horde of beasts that were rushing up the gully\ntoward them.\n \n  \"My God!\" he said. \"What are those?\"\n \n  Syme looked. \"Those,\" he said bitterly, \"are Martians.\"\n \n  The natives, like all Martian fauna, were multi-legged. Also like all\nMartian fauna, they moved so fast that you couldn't see how many legs\nthey did have. Actually, however, the natives had six legs apiece—or,\nmore properly, four legs and two arms. Their lungs were not as large\nas they appeared, being collapsed at the moment. What caused the bulge\nthat made their torsos look like sausages was a huge air bladder, with\na valve arrangement from the stomach and feeding directly into the\nbloodstream.\n \n  Their faces were vaguely canine, but the foreheads were high, and the\nlips were not split. They did resemble dogs, in that their thick black\nfur was splotched with irregulate patches of white. These patches of\nwhite were subject to muscular control and could be spread out fanwise;\nor, conversely, the black could be expanded to cover the white, which\nhelped to take care of the extremes of Martian temperature. Right now\nthey were mostly black.\n \n  The natives slowed down and spread out to surround the wrecked sand\ncar, and it could be seen that most of them were armed with spears,\nalthough some had the slim Benson energy guns—strictly forbidden to\nMartians.\n \n  Syme stopped cursing and watched tensely. Tate said nothing, but he\nswallowed audibly.\n \n  One Martian, who looked exactly like all the rest, stepped forward and\nmotioned unmistakably for the two to come out. He waited a moment and\nthen gestured with his energy gun. That gun, Syme knew from experience,\ncould burn through a small thickness of steelite if held on the same\nspot long enough.\n\"Come on,\" Syme said grimly. He rose and reached for a pressure suit,\nand Tate followed him.\n \n  \"What do you think they'll—\" he began, and then stopped himself. \"I\nknow. They're unpredictable.\"\n \n  \"Yeah,\" said Syme, and opened the door. The air in the car\nwhooshed\ninto the near-vacuum outside, and he and Tate stepped out.\n \n  The Martian leader looked at them enigmatically, then turned and\nstarted off. The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded\nalong under the weak gravity.\n \n  They bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a\nhalf, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down\nit, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,\nthey could see the walls of the gully—a tunnel, now—getting darker\nand more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine\nkilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.\n \n  The tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a\nphosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't\ndecide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though.\n \n  \"There's air here,\" he said to Tate. \"I can see dust motes in it.\" He\nswitched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane\non the outside of the helmet. \"\nKalis methra\n,\" he began haltingly,\n\"\nseltin guna getal.\n\"\n \n  \"Yes, there is air here,\" said the Martian leader, startlingly. \"Not\nenough for your use, however, so do not open your helmets.\"\n \n  Syme swore amazedly.\n \n  \"I thought you said they didn't speak Terrestrial,\" Tate said. Syme\nignored him.\n \n  \"We had our reasons for not doing so,\" the Martian said.\n \n  \"But how—?\"\n \n  \"We are telepaths, of course. On a planet which is nearly airless on\nits surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to\nignore the obvious. We have not had a spoken language of our own for\nseveral thousand years.\"\n \n  He darted a glance at Syme's darkly scowling face. His own hairy face\nwas expressionless, but Syme sensed that he was amused. \"Yes, you're\nright,\" he said. \"The language you and your fellows struggled to learn\nis a fraud, a hodge-podge concocted to deceive you.\"\n \n  Tate looked interested. \"But why this—this gigantic masquerade?\"\n \n  \"You had nothing to give us,\" the Martian said simply.\n \n  Tate frowned, then flushed. \"You mean you avoided revealing yourselves\nbecause you—had nothing to gain from mental intercourse with us?\"\n \n  \"Yes.\"\n \n  Tate thought again. \"But—\"\n \n  \"No,\" the Martian interrupted him, \"revealing the extent of our\ncivilization would have spared us nothing at your people's hands. Yours\nis an imperialist culture, and you would have had Mars, whether you\nthought you were taking it from equals or not.\"\n \n  \"Never mind that,\" Syme broke in impatiently. \"What do you want with\nus?\"\n \n  The Martian looked at him appraisingly. \"You already suspect.\nUnfortunately, you must die.\"\nIt was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet\nhe could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep\nthe Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian\nmust have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,\nholding himself in check with an effort.\n \n  \"Will you tell us why?\" Tate asked.\n \n  \"You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception\nof justice. I will tell you and your—friend—anything you wish to\nknow.\"\n \n  Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of\nthe cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the\nleader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away\nfrom them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to\nthink about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like\ntrying not to think of the word \"hippopotamus.\"\n \n  Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently\nunconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. \"First why—\" he\nbegan.\n \n  \"There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,\" the Martian said, \"among them a\nvery simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform\nMars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.\"\n \n  \"I think I see,\" Tate said thoughtfully. \"That's been the ultimate aim\nall along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then\nwe'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.\nYou couldn't have that, of course.\"\n \n  He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked\nat them with a queer intentness. \"Well—how about the Martians—the\nKal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that\none.\"\n \n  \"Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a\nseparate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our\nancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.\"\n \n  \"Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make\nitself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves\ninto cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to\nthe new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem\nwas an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for\nwe progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained\nits slaves. They died of a plague—and other causes.\n \n  \"You see,\" he finished gently, \"our deception has caused a natural\nconfusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.\"\n \n  \"And yet,\" Tate mused, \"you are being destroyed by contact with\nan—inferior—culture.\"\n \n  \"We hope to win yet,\" the Martian said.\n \n  Tate stood up, his face very white. \"Tell me one thing,\" he begged.\n\"Will our two races ever live together in amity?\"\n \n  The Martian lowered his head. \"That is for unborn generations.\" He\nlooked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. \"You are a brave man,\"\nhe said. \"I am sorry.\"\n \n  Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down the\nsights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage in\nhim exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before\nhe knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the\nMartian.\nIt was like tangling with a draft horse. The Martian was astonishingly\nstrong. Syme scrambled desperately for the gun, got it, but couldn't\ntear it out of the Martian's fingers. And all the time he could almost\nfeel the Martian's telepathic call for help surging out. He heard the\nswift pad of his followers coming across the cavern.\n \n  He put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort. Every\nmuscle fiber in his superbly trained body crackled and surged with\npower. He roared his fury. And the gun twisted out of the Martian's\niron grip!\n \n  He clubbed the prostrate leader with it instantly, then reversed the\nweapon and snapped a shot at the nearest Martian. The creature dropped\nhis lance and fell without a sound.\n \n  The next instant a ray blinked at him, and he rolled out of the way\nbarely in time. The searing ray cut a swath over the leader's body and\nswerved to cut down on him. Still rolling, he fired at the holder of\nthe weapon. The gun dropped and winked out on the floor.\n \n  Syme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies, snarling like the\ntrapped tiger he was. Another ray slashed at him, and he bent lithely\nto let it whistle over his head. Another, lower this time. He flipped\nhis body into the air and landed upright, his gun still blazing. His\nright leg burned fiercely from a ray-graze, but he ignored it. And\nall the while he was mowing down the massed natives in great swaths,\nseeking out the ones armed with Bensons in swift, terrible slashes,\ndodging spears and other missiles in midair, and roaring at the top of\nhis powerful lungs.\n \n  At last there were none with guns left to oppose him. He scythed down\nthe rest in two terrible, lightning sweeps of his ray, then dropped\nthe weapon from blistered fingers.\n \n  He was gasping for breath, and realized that he was losing air from\nthe seared-open right leg of his suit. He reached for the emergency\nkit at his side, drawing in great, gasping breaths, and fumbled out\na tube of sealing liquid. He spread the stuff on liberally, smearing\nit impartially over flesh and fabric. It felt like liquid hell on the\nburned, bleeding leg, but he kept on until the quick-drying fluid\nformed an airtight patch.\n \n  Only then did he turn, to see Tate flattened against the wall behind\nhim, his hands empty at his sides. \"I'm sorry,\" Tate said miserably. \"I\ncould have grabbed a spear or something, but—I just couldn't, not even\nto save my own life. I—I halfway hoped they'd kill both of us.\"\n \n  Syme glared at him and spat, too enraged to think of diplomacy. He\nturned and strode out of the cavern, carrying his right leg stiffly,\nbut with his feral, tigerish head held high.\n \n  He led the way, wordlessly, back to the wrecked sand car. Tate followed\nhim with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something\nthat shattered all his previous concepts of the verities in life, and\ndidn't know what to do about it.\n \n  Still silently, Syme refilled his oxygen tank, watched Tate do the\nsame, and then picked up two spare tanks and the precious black\nsuitcase and handed one of the tanks to Tate. Then he stumped around\nto the back of the car and inspected the damage. The cable reel, which\nmight have drawn them out of the gully, was hopelessly smashed. That\nwas that.\nThey started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to\na fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening. When they\nfinally reached a climbable spot, Syme was limping badly and Tate was\nobviously exhausted.\n \n  They clambered wearily out onto the level sands again just as the\nsmall, blazing sun was setting. \"Luck,\" grunted Syme. \"Our only chance\nof getting near the city is at night.\" He peered around, shading his\neyes from the sun's glare with a gauntleted hand. \"See that?\"\n \n  Following his pointing finger, Tate saw a faint, ephemeral arc showing\nabove a line of low hills in the distance. \"Kal-Jmar,\" said Syme.\n \n  Tate brightened a little. His body was too filled with fatigue for his\nmind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it\nreceded into the back of his mind.\n \n  \"Kal-Jmar,\" whispered Syme again.\n \n  There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,\nand darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen\ntank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and\nstarted toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed\nagain.\n \n  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their\nway past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters\non all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning\ndetermination, they had managed to escape detection—and there they\nwere. Journey's end.\n \n  Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless\nadmiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,\nstill their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made\nsolid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the\ndecay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and\npreserved for all eternity.\n \n  \"Well?\" demanded Syme.\n \n  Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black\nsuitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.\n \n  Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile\ncontrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror. It\nhad a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of\nthat tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling\nslightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him\nclosely, his big body tensed with expectation.\n \n  The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It\nlooked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no\npower man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate\nthat screen.\n \n  Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,\nand closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.\n \n  Nothing happened.\n \n  The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.\nThere was no change.\nTate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between\nhis pale, serious eyes. Syme stood stock-still but quivering with\nrepressed energy, scowling like a thundercloud.\n \n  \"It must be capable of working,\" Tate told himself querulously. \"The\nMartians knew—they wouldn't have tried to stop us if—Wait a minute.\"\nHe paced back and forth, biting his lip. Syme watched him with catlike\neyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.\n \n  Tate paused. \"I think I have it,\" he said slowly. \"I haven't enough\npower to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically\npossible. But there must be weaker portions of the field—doors—set\nto open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power\nenough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if\nyou'd built Kal-Jmar?\"\n \n  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. \"A thousand years\nago?\" he muttered. \"Two thousand? These hills were raised in five\nhundred. We can't go by topography.\n \n  \"In front of one of the main arteries, then. But there are dozens, no\none larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?\"\n \n  \"Maybe,\" said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of\nKal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. \"It's the nearest—as\ngood as any other.\"\n \n  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his\nequipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until\nhe had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a\nlong breath, and closed the switch again.\n \n  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For\na moment there was nothing, and then—\n \n  Tate clutched the big man's arm. \"Look!\" he breathed.\n \n  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing\nspot of violet radiance! As they watched it widened, dilating into a\nperfect circle of violet, enclosing nothingness. The door was opening.\n \n  \"It worked,\" Tate said softly. \"It worked!\"\n \n  Syme shook off his grip impatiently, put his hand to the gun in the\nholster of his suit. Tate was still watching, fascinated. \"Look,\" he\nsaid again. \"The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.\nI think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will\nclose.\" He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.\n \n  \"Wait,\" Syme said hoarsely. \"You forgot the machine.\"\n \n  Tate turned, said, \"Oh yes,\" and walked back. Then he saw the gun in\nSyme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He\njust stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.\n \n  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.\n \n  He dropped like a rag doll, but Syme's aim had been bad. He wasn't dead\nyet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of\nhimself, Syme bent forward to listen.\n \n  \"\nYou'll be\n—\nsorry\n,\" Tate said, and died.\n \n  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme\nstraightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been\nunreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had\nforgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the\nman who knew the answers, was dead. But—he'd be sorry!\n \n  For what? Another dead fool?\n \n  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep\nlungs, stepped forward through the opening.\nThe towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode\nlike a conqueror down the long-deserted avenue. The city was full of\nthe whisperings of Kal-Jmar's ancient wraiths, but they touched only\na corner of his mind. He was filled to overflowing with the bright,\nglowing joy of conquest. The city was his!\n \n  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,\nyet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for\nhim. He was intoxicated.\nThe city was his!\nThere was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing\nin the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,\nthe city blazed with treasures beyond price.\nIt was his!\nThe ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a\nbuilding. Syme strode up to the threshold, and the door dilated for\nhim. He stepped inside; the door closed and a soft light glowed on.\n \n  There was air here: good, breathable air. A tiny zephyr of it was\nblowing from some hidden source against his body. Greatly daring, he\nunfastened the helmet of his suit and flung it back. He breathed in a\nlungful of it. God, but it was good after that canned stuff! It was a\nlittle heady; it made his head swim—but it was good air, excellent air!\n \n  He looked around him, measuring, assessing for the first time. This\nroom alone was worth a fortune. There was platinum; in ornaments, set\ninto the walls, in furniture. That would be enough to buy the little\nthings—a new ship, or perhaps even immunity back on Earth. But that\nwas as nothing to the rest of it, the things three worlds would clamor\nfor—the artifacts, the record books, the machines!\n \n  He strode about the room, building plan on grandiose plan. He could\ntake back only a little with him at first; but he could return again\nand again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore\nthe city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An\ninvincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps\neven a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away\nfrom Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy\nengine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain\nto take him wherever he chose to go!\nHe stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming\nwith glory—and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the\ncontainer of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped\nthem into his mouth.\n \n  They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.\nNo food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His\nmouth began to water at the very thought.\n \n  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme\nwhirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was\nremarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.\n \n  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in\nrepair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,\nand so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not\nknow, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,\nand not the distilled liquor of the\nxopa\nfungus, which still grew in\nthe subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving\nthe mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.\n \n  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the\nrobot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its\nflexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before\nhe could move to avoid it. And down Syme Rector's throat poured a flood\nof\nxopa\n-juice, nectar to Martians, but swift, terrible death to human\nbeings....\n \n  Outside, the last doorway to Kal-Jmar closed forever, across from the\ncold body of Tate.", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "63392", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n\n Every lonely man tries to make friends. Manet just didn't know when to stop!\n \n \n \n William Manet was alone.\n \n In the beginning, he had seen many advantages to being alone. It would give him an unprecedented opportunity to once and for all correlate loneliness to the point of madness, to see how long it would take him to start slavering and clawing the pin-ups from the magazines, to begin teaching himself classes in philosophy consisting of interminable lectures to a bored and captive audience of one.\n \n He would be able to measure the qualities of peace and decide whether it was really better than war, he would be able to get as fat and as dirty as he liked, he would be able to live more like an animal and think more like a god than any man for generations.\n \n But after a shorter time than he expected, it all got to be a tearing bore. Even the waiting to go crazy part of it.\n \n Not that he was going to have any great long wait of it. He was already talking to himself, making verbal notes for his lectures, and he had cut out a picture of Annie Oakley from an old book. He tacked it up and winked at it whenever he passed that way.\n \n Lately she was winking back at him.\n \n Loneliness was a physical weight on his skull. It peeled the flesh from his arms and legs and sandpapered his self-pity to a fine sensitivity.\n \n No one on Earth was as lonely as William Manet, and even William Manet could only be this lonely on Mars.\n \n Manet was Atmosphere Seeder Station 131-47's own human.\n \n All Manet had to do was sit in the beating aluminum heart in the middle of the chalk desert and stare out, chin cupped in hands, at the flat, flat pavement of dirty talcum, at the stars gleaming as hard in the black sky as a starlet's capped teeth ... stars two of which were moons and one of which was Earth. He had to do nothing else. The whole gimcrack was cybernetically controlled, entirely automatic. No one was needed here—no human being, at least.\n \n The Workers' Union was a pretty small pressure group, but it didn't take much to pressure the Assembly. Featherbedding had been carefully specified, including an Overseer for each of the Seeders to honeycomb Mars, to prepare its atmosphere for colonization.\n \n They didn't give tests to find well-balanced, well-integrated people for the job. Well-balanced, well-integrated men weren't going to isolate themselves in a useless job. They got, instead, William Manet and his fellows.\n \n The Overseers were to stay as long as the job required. Passenger fare to Mars was about one billion dollars. They weren't providing commuter service for night shifts. They weren't providing accommodations for couples when the law specified only one occupant. They weren't providing fuel (at fifty million dollars a gallon) for visits between the various Overseers. They weren't very providential.\n \n But it was two hundred thousand a year in salary, and it offered wonderful opportunities.\n \n It gave William Manet an opportunity to think he saw a spaceship making a tailfirst landing on the table of the desert, its tail burning as bright as envy.\n \n \n\n \n Manet suspected hallucination, but in an existence with all the pallid dispassion of a requited love he was happy to welcome dementia. Sometimes he even manufactured it. Sometimes he would run through the arteries of the factory and play that it had suddenly gone mad hating human beings, and was about to close down its bulkheads on him as sure as the Engineers' Thumb and bale up the pressure-dehydrated digest, making so much stall flooring of him. He ran until he dropped with a kind of climaxing release of terror.\n \n So Manet put on the pressure suit he had been given because he would never need it, and marched out to meet the visiting spaceship.\n \n He wasn't quite clear how he came from walking effortlessly across the Martian plain that had all the distance-perpetuating qualities of a kid's crank movie machine to the comfortable interior of a strange cabin. Not a ship's cabin but a Northwoods cabin.\n \n The black and orange Hallowe'en log charring in the slate stone fireplace seemed real. So did the lean man with the smiling mustache painted with the random designs of the fire, standing before the horizontal pattern of chinked wall.\n \n \"Need a fresher?\" the host inquired.\n \n Manet's eyes wondered down to heavy water tumbler full of rich, amber whiskey full of sparks from the hearth. He stirred himself in the comfortingly warm leather chair. \"No, no, I'm fine .\" He let the word hang there for examination. \"Pardon me, but could you tell me just what place this is?\"\n \n The host shrugged. It was the only word for it. \"Whatever place you choose it to be, so long as you're with Trader Tom. 'Service,' that's my motto. It is a way of life with me.\"\n \n \"Trader Tom? Service?\"\n \n \"Yes! That's it exactly. It's me exactly. Trader Tom Service—Serving the Wants of the Spaceman Between the Stars. Of course, 'stars' is poetic. Any point of light in the sky in a star. We service the planets.\"\n \n Manet took the tumbler in both hands and drank. It was good whiskey, immensely powerful. \"The government wouldn't pay for somebody serving the wants of spacemen,\" he exploded.\n \n \"Ah,\" Trader Tom said, cautionary. He moved nearer the fire and warmed his hands and buttocks. \"Ah, but I am not a government service. I represent free enterprise.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Nonsense,\" Manet said. \"No group of private individuals can build a spaceship. It takes a combine of nations.\"\n \n \"But remember only that businessmen are reactionary. It's well-known. Ask anyone on the street. Businessmen are reactionary even beyond the capitalistic system. Money is a fiction that exists mostly on paper. They play along on paper to get paper things, but to get real things they can forego the papers. Comprehend, mon ami ? My businessmen have gone back to the barter system. Between them, they have the raw materials, the trained men, the man-hours to make a spaceship. So they make it. Damned reactionaries, all of my principals.\"\n \n \"I don't believe you,\" Manet stated flatly. His conversation had grown blunt with disuse. \"What possible profit could your principals turn from running a trading ship among scattered exploration posts on the planets? What could you give us that a benevolent government doesn't already supply us with? And if there was anything, how could we pay for it? My year's salary wouldn't cover the transportation costs of this glass of whiskey.\"\n \n \"Do you find it good whiskey?\"\n \n \"Very good.\"\n \n \"Excellent?\"\n \n \"Excellent, if you prefer.\"\n \n \"I only meant—but never mind. We give you what you want. As for paying for it—why, forget about the payment. You may apply for a Trader Tom Credit Card.\"\n \n \"And I could buy anything that I wanted with it?\" Manet demanded.\n\"That's absurd. I'd never be able to pay for it.\"\n \n \"That's it precisely!\" Trader Tom said with enthusiasm. \"You never pay for it. Charges are merely deducted from your estate .\"\n \n \"But I may leave no estate!\"\n \n Trader Tom demonstrated his peculiar shrug. \"All businesses operate on a certain margin of risk. That is our worry.\"\n \n \n\n \n Manet finished the mellow whiskey and looked into the glass. It seemed to have been polished clean. \"What do you have to offer?\"\n \n \"Whatever you want?\"\n \n Irritably, \"How do I know what I want until I know what you have?\"\n \n \"You know.\"\n \n \"I know? All right, I know. You don't have it for sale.\"\n \n \"Old chap, understand if you please that I do not only sell . I am a trader—Trader Tom. I trade with many parties. There are, for example ... extraterrestrials.\"\n \n \"Folk legend!\"\n \n \"On the contrary, mon cher , the only reality it lacks is political reality. The Assembly could no longer justify their disposition of the cosmos if it were known they were dealing confiscation without representation. Come, tell me what you want.\"\n \n Manet gave in to it. \"I want to be not alone,\" he said.\n \n \"Of course,\" Trader Tom replied, \"I suspected. It is not so unusual, you know. Sign here. And here. Two copies. This is yours. Thank you so much.\"\n \n Manet handed back the pen and stared at the laminated card in his hand.\n \n \n\n \n When he looked up from the card, Manet saw the box. Trader Tom was pushing it across the floor towards him.\n \n The box had the general dimensions of a coffin, but it wasn't wood—only brightly illustrated cardboard. There was a large four-color picture on the lid showing men, women and children moving through a busy city street. The red and blue letters said:\n \n \n LIFO\n   The Socialization Kit\n \n \n \"It is commercialized,\" Trader Tom admitted with no little chagrin.\n\"It is presented to appeal to a twelve-year-old child, an erotic, aggressive twelve-year-old, the typical sensie goer—but that is reality. It offends men of good taste like ourselves, yet sometimes it approaches being art. We must accept it.\"\n \n \"What's the cost?\" Manet asked. \"Before I accept it, I have to know the charges.\"\n \n \"You never know the cost. Only your executor knows that. It's the Trader Tom plan.\"\n \n \"Well, is it guaranteed?\"\n \n \"There are no guarantees,\" Trader Tom admitted. \"But I've never had any complaints yet.\"\n \n \"Suppose I'm the first?\" Manet suggested reasonably.\n \n \"You won't be,\" Trader Tom said. \"I won't pass this way again.\"\n \n \n\n \n Manet didn't open the box. He let it fade quietly in the filtered but still brilliant sunlight near a transparent wall.\n \n Manet puttered around the spawning monster, trying to brush the copper taste of the station out of his mouth in the mornings, talking to himself, winking at Annie Oakley, and waiting to go mad.\n \n Finally, Manet woke up one morning. He lay in the sheets of his bunk, suppressing the urge to go wash his hands, and came at last to the conclusion that, after all the delay, he was mad.\n \n So he went to open the box.\n \n The cardboard lid seemed to have become both brittle and rotten. It crumbled as easily as ideals. But Manet was old enough to remember the boxes Japanese toys came in when he was a boy, and was not alarmed.\n \n The contents were such a glorious pile of junk, of bottles from old chemistry sets, of pieces from old Erector sets, of nameless things and unremembered antiques from neglected places, that it seemed too good to have been assembled commercially. It was the collection of lifetime.\n \n On top of everything was a paperbound book, the size of the Reader's Digest , covered in rippled gray flexiboard. The title was stamped in black on the spine and cover: The Making of Friends .\n \n Manet opened the book and, turning one blank page, found the title in larger print and slightly amplified: The Making of Friends and Others . There was no author listed. A further line of information stated: \"A Manual for Lifo, The Socialization Kit.\" At the bottom of the title page, the publisher was identified as: LIFO KIT CO., LTD., SYRACUSE.\n \n The unnumbered first chapter was headed Your First Friend .\n \n Before you go further, first find the Modifier in your kit. This is vital .\n \n He quickly riffled through the pages. Other Friends, Authority, A Companion .... Then The Final Model . Manet tried to flip past this section, but the pages after the sheet labeled The Final Model were stuck together. More than stuck. There was a thick slab of plastic in the back of the book. The edges were ridged as if there were pages to this section, but they could only be the tracks of lame ants.\n \n Manet flipped back to page one.\n \n First find the Modifier in your kit. This is vital to your entire experiment in socialization. The Modifier is Part #A-1 on the Master Chart.\n \n He prowled through the box looking for some kind of a chart. There was nothing that looked like a chart inside. He retrieved the lid and looked at its inside. Nothing. He tipped the box and looked at its outside. Not a thing. There was always something missing from kits. Maybe even the Modifier itself.\n \n He read on, and probed and scattered the parts in the long box. He studied the manual intently and groped out with his free hand.\n \n The toe bone was connected to the foot bone....\n \n \n\n \n The Red King sat smugly in his diagonal corner.\n \n The Black King stood two places away, his top half tipsy in frustration.\n \n The Red King crabbed sideways one square.\n \n The Black King pounced forward one space.\n \n The Red King advanced backwards to face the enemy.\n \n The Black King shuffled sideways.\n \n The Red King followed....\n \n Uselessly.\n \n \"Tie game,\" Ronald said.\n \n \"Tie game,\" Manet said.\n \n \"Let's talk,\" Ronald said cheerfully. He was always cheerful.\n \n Cheerfulness was a personality trait Manet had thumbed out for him. Cheerful. Submissive. Co-operative. Manet had selected these factors in order to make Ronald as different a person from himself as possible.\n \n \"The Korean-American War was the greatest of all wars,\" Ronald said pontifically.\n \n \"Only in the air,\" Manet corrected him.\n \n Intelligence was one of the factors Manet had punched to suppress. Intelligence. Aggressiveness. Sense of perfection. Ronald couldn't know any more than Manet, but he could (and did) know less. He had seen to that when his own encephalograph matrix had programmed Ronald's feeder.\n \n \"There were no dogfights in Korea,\" Ronald said.\n \n \"I know.\"\n \n \"The dogfight was a combat of hundreds of planes in a tight area, the last of which took place near the end of the First World War. The aerial duel, sometimes inaccurately referred to as a 'dogfight' was not seen in Korea either. The pilots at supersonic speeds only had time for single passes at the enemy. Still, I believe, contrary to all experts, that this took greater skill, man more wedded to machine, than the leisurely combats of World War One.\"\n \n \"I know.\"\n \n \"Daniel Boone was still a crack shot at eight-five. He was said to be warm, sincere, modest, truthful, respected and rheumatic.\"\n \n \"I know.\"\n \n \n\n \n Manet knew it all. He had heard it all before.\n \n He was so damned sick of hearing about Korean air battles, Daniel Boone, the literary qualities of ancient sports fiction magazines, the painting of Norman Rockwell, New York swing, ad nauseum . What a narrow band of interests! With the whole universe to explore in thought and concept, why did he have to be trapped with such an unoriginal human being?\n \n Of course, Ronald wasn't an original human being. He was a copy.\n \n Manet had been interested in the Fabulous Forties—Lt. \"Hoot\" Gibson, Sam Merwin tennis stories, Saturday Evening Post covers—when he had first learned of them, and he had learned all about them. He had firm opinions on all these.\n \n He yearned for someone to challenge him—to say that Dime Sports had been nothing but a cheap yellow rag and, why, Sewanee Review , there had been a magazine for you.\n \n Manet's only consolidation was that Ronald's tastes were lower than his own. He patriotically insisted that the American Sabre Jet was superior to the Mig. He maintained with a straight face that Tommy Dorsey was a better band man than Benny Goodman. Ronald was a terrific jerk.\n \n \"Ronald,\" Manet said, \"you are a terrific jerk.\"\n \n Ronald leaped up immediately and led with his right.\n \n Manet blocked it deftly and threw a right cross.\n \n Ronald blocked it deftly, and drove in a right to the navel.\n \n The two men separated and, puffing like steam locomotives passing the diesel works, closed again.\n \n Ronald leaped forward and led with his right.\n \n Manet stepped inside the swing and lifted an uppercut to the ledge of Ronald's jaw.\n \n Ronald pinwheeled to the floor.\n \n He lifted his bruised head from the deck and worked his reddened mouth.\n\"Had enough?\" he asked Manet.\n \n Manet dropped his fists to his sides and turned away. \"Yes.\"\n \n Ronald hopped up lightly. \"Another checkers, Billy Boy?\"\n \n \"No.\"\n \n \"Okay. Anything you want, William, old conquerer.\"\n \n Manet scrunched up inside himself in impotent fury.\n \n Ronald was maddeningly co-operative and peaceful. He would even get in a fist fight to avoid trouble between them. He would do anything Manet wanted him to do. He was so utterly damned stupid.\n \n Manet's eyes orbitted towards the checkerboard.\n \n But if he were so much more stupid than he, Manet, why was it that their checker games always ended in a tie?\n \n \n\n \n The calendar said it was Spring on Earth when the radio was activated for a high-speed information and entertainment transmission.\n \n The buzzer-flasher activated in the solarium at the same time.\n \n Manet lay stretched out on his back, naked, in front of the transparent wall.\n \n By rolling his eyes back in his head, Manet could see over a hedge of eyebrows for several hundred flat miles of white sand.\n \n And several hundred miles of desert could see him.\n \n For a moment he gloried in the blatant display of his flabby muscles and patchy sunburn.\n \n Then he sighed, rolled over to his feet and started trudging toward Communication.\n \n He padded down the rib-ridged matted corridor, taking his usual small pleasure in the kaleidoscopic effect of the spiraling reflections on the walls of the tubeway.\n \n As he passed the File Room, he caught the sound of the pounding vibrations against the stoppered plug of the hatch.\n \n \"Come on, Billy Buddy, let me out of this place!\"\n \n Manet padded on down the hall. He had, he recalled, shoved Ronald in there on Lincoln's Birthday, a minor ironic twist he appreciated quietly. He had been waiting in vain for Ronald to run down ever since.\n \n In Communication, he took a seat and punched the slowed down playback of the transmission.\n \n \"Hello, Overseers,\" the Voice said. It was the Voice of the B.B.C. It irritated Manet. He never understood how the British had got the space transmissions assignment for the English language. He would have preferred an American disk-jockey himself, one who appreciated New York swing.\n \n \"We imagine that you are most interested in how long you shall be required to stay at your present stations,\" said the Voice of God's paternal uncle. \"As you on Mars may know, there has been much discussion as to how long it will require to complete the present schedule—\" there was of course no \"K\" sound in the word—\"for atmosphere seeding.\n \n \"The original, non-binding estimate at the time of your departure was\n18.2 years. However, determining how long it will take our stations properly to remake the air of Mars is a problem comparable to finding the age of the Earth. Estimates change as new factors are learned. You may recall that three years ago the official estimate was changed to thirty-one years. The recent estimate by certain reactionary sources of two hundred and seventy-four years is not an official government estimate. The news for you is good, if you are becoming nostalgic for home, or not particularly bad if you are counting on drawing your handsome salary for the time spent on Mars. We have every reason to believe our original estimate was substantially correct. The total time is, within limits of error, a flat 18 years.\"\n \n A very flat 18 years, Manet thought as he palmed off the recorder.\n \n He sat there thinking about eighteen years.\n \n He did not switch to video for some freshly taped westerns.\n \n Finally, Manet went back to the solarium and dragged the big box out. There was a lot left inside.\n \n One of those parts, one of those bones or struts of flesh sprayers, one of them, he now knew, was the Modifier.\n \n The Modifier was what he needed to change Ronald. Or to shut him off.\n \n If only the Master Chart hadn't been lost, so he would know what the Modifier looked like! He hoped the Modifier itself wasn't lost. He hated to think of Ronald locked in the Usher tomb of the File Room for 18 flat years. Long before that, he would have worn his fists away hammering at the hatch. Then he might start pounding with his head. Perhaps before the time was up he would have worn himself down to nothing whatsoever.\n \n Manet selected the ripple-finished gray-covered manual from the hodgepodge, and thought: eighteen years.\n \n Perhaps I should have begun here, he told himself. But I really don't have as much interest in that sort of thing as the earthier types. Simple companionship was all I wanted. And, he thought on, even an insipid personality like Ronald's would be bearable with certain compensations.\n \n Manet opened the book to the chapter headed: The Making of a Girl .\n \n \n\n \n Veronica crept up behind Manet and slithered her hands up his back and over his shoulders. She leaned forward and breathed a moist warmth into his ear, and worried the lobe with her even white teeth.\n \n \"Daniel Boone,\" she sighed huskily, \"only killed three Indians in his life.\"\n \n \"I know.\"\n \n Manet folded his arms stoically and added: \"Please don't talk.\"\n \n She sighed her instant agreement and moved her expressive hands over his chest and up to the hollows of his throat.\n \n \"I need a shave,\" he observed.\n \n Her hands instantly caressed his face to prove that she liked a rather bristly, masculine countenance.\n \n Manet elbowed Veronica away in a gentlemanly fashion.\n \n She made her return.\n \n \"Not now,\" he instructed her.\n \n \"Whenever you say.\"\n \n He stood up and began pacing off the dimensions of the compartment. There was no doubt about it: he had been missing his regular exercise.\n \n \"Now?\" she asked.\n \n \"I'll tell you.\"\n \n \"If you were a jet pilot,\" Veronica said wistfully, \"you would be romantic. You would grab love when you could. You would never know which moment would be last. You would make the most of each one.\"\n \n \"I'm not a jet pilot,\" Manet said. \"There are no jet pilots. There haven't been any for generations.\"\n \n \"Don't be silly,\" Veronica said. \"Who else would stop those vile North Koreans and Red China 'volunteers'?\"\n \n \"Veronica,\" he said carefully, \"the Korean War is over. It was finished even before the last of the jet pilots.\"\n \n \"Don't be silly,\" she snapped. \"If it were over, I'd know about it, wouldn't I?\"\n \n She would, except that somehow she had turned out even less bright, less equipped with Manet's own store of information, than Ronald. Whoever had built the Lifo kit must have had ancient ideas about what constituted appropriate \"feminine\" characteristics.\n \n \"I suppose,\" he said heavily, \"that you would like me to take you back to Earth and introduce you to Daniel Boone?\"\n \n \"Oh, yes.\"\n \n \"Veronica, your stupidity is hideous.\"\n \n She lowered her long blonde lashes on her pink cheeks. \"That is a mean thing to say to me. But I forgive you.\"\n \n An invisible hand began pressing down steadily on the top of his head until it forced a sound out of him. \"Aaaawrraagggh! Must you be so cloyingly sweet? Do you have to keep taking that? Isn't there any fight in you at all?\"\n \n He stepped forward and back-handed her across the jaw.\n \n It was the first time he had ever struck a woman, he realized regretfully. He now knew he should have been doing it long ago.\n \n Veronica sprang forward and led with a right.\n \n \n\n \n Ronald's cries grew louder as Manet marched Veronica through the corridor.\n \n \"Hear that?\" he inquired, smiling with clenched teeth.\n \n \"No, darling.\"\n \n Well, that was all right. He remembered he had once told her to ignore the noise. She was still following orders.\n \n \"Come on, Bill, open up the hatch for old Ronald,\" the voice carried through sepulchrally.\n \n \"Shut up!\" Manet yelled.\n \n The voice dwindled stubbornly, then cut off.\n \n A silence with a whisper of metallic ring to it.\n \n Why hadn't he thought of that before? Maybe because he secretly took comfort in the sound of an almost human voice echoing through the station.\n \n Manet threw back the bolt and wheeled back the hatch.\n \n Ronald looked just the same as had when Manet had seen him last. His hands didn't seem to have been worn away in the least. Ronald's lips seemed a trifle chapped. But that probably came not from all the shouting but from having nothing to drink for some months.\n \n Ronald didn't say anything to Manet.\n \n But he looked offended.\n \n \"You,\" Manet said to Veronica with a shove in the small of the back,\n\"inside, inside.\"\n \n Ronald sidestepped the lurching girl.\n \n \"Do you know what I'm going to do with you?\" Manet demanded. \"I'm going to lock you up in here, and leave you for a day, a month, a year, forever! Now what do you think about that?\"\n \n \"If you think it's the right thing, dear,\" Veronica said hesitantly.\n \n \"You know best, Willy,\" Ronald said uncertainly.\n \n Manet slammed the hatch in disgust.\n \n Manet walked carefully down the corridor, watching streamers of his reflection corkscrewing into the curved walls. He had to walk carefully, else the artery would roll up tight and squash him. But he walked too carefully for this to happen.\n \n As he passed the File Room, Ronald's voice said: \"In my opinion, William, you should let us out.\"\n \n \"I,\" Veronica said, \"honestly feel that you should let me out, Bill, dearest.\"\n \n Manet giggled. \"What? What was that? Do you suggest that I take you back after you've been behind a locked door with my best friend?\"\n \n He went down the corridor, giggling.\n \n He giggled and thought: This will never do.\n \n \n\n \n Pouring and tumbling through the Lifo kit, consulting the manual diligently, Manet concluded that there weren't enough parts left in the box to go around.\n \n The book gave instructions for The Model Mother, The Model Father, The Model Sibling and others. Yet there weren't parts enough in the kit.\n \n He would have to take parts from Ronald or Veronica in order to make any one of the others. And he could not do that without the Modifier.\n \n He wished Trader Tom would return and extract some higher price from him for the Modifier, which was clearly missing from the kit.\n \n Or to get even more for simply repossessing the kit.\n \n But Trader Tom would not be back. He came this way only once.\n \n Manet thumbed through the manual in mechanical frustration. As he did so, the solid piece of the last section parted sheet by sheet.\n \n He glanced forward and found the headings: The Final Model .\n \n There seemed something ominous about that finality. But he had paid a price for the kit, hadn't he? Who knew what price, when it came to that? He had every right to get everything out of the kit that he could.\n \n He read the unfolding page critically. The odd assortment of ill-matched parts left in the box took a new shape in his mind and under his fingers....\n \n Manet gave one final spurt from the flesh-sprayer and stood back.\n \n Victor was finished. Perfect.\n \n Manet stepped forward, lifted the model's left eyelid, tweaked his nose.\n \n \"Move!\"\n \n Victor leaped back into the Lifo kit and did a jig on one of the flesh-sprayers.\n \n As the device twisted as handily as good intentions, Manet realized that it was not a flesh-sprayer but the Modifier.\n \n \"It's finished!\" were Victor's first words. \"It's done!\"\n \n Manet stared at the tiny wreck. \"To say the least.\"\n \n Victor stepped out of the oblong box. \"There is something you should understand. I am different from the others.\"\n \n \"They all say that.\"\n \n \"I am not your friend.\"\n \n \"No?\"\n \n \"No. You have made yourself an enemy.\"\n \n Manet felt nothing more at this information than an esthetic pleasure at the symmetry of the situation.\n \n \"It completes the final course in socialization,\" Victor continued. \"I am your adversary. I will do everything I can to defeat you. I have all your knowledge. You do not have all your knowledge. If you let yourself know some of the things, it could be used against you. It is my function to use everything I possibly can against you.\"\n \n \"When do you start?\"\n \n \"I've finished. I've done my worst. I have destroyed the Modifier.\"\n \n \"What's so bad about that?\" Manet asked with some interest.\n \n \"You'll have Veronica and Ronald and me forever now. We'll never change. You'll get older, and we'll never change. You'll lose your interest in New York swing and jet combat and Daniel Boone, and we'll never change. We don't change and you can't change us for others. I've made the worst thing happen to you that can happen to any man. I've seen that you will always keep your friends. \"\n \n \n\n \n The prospect was frightful.\n \n Victor smiled. \"Aren't you going to denounce me for a fiend?\"\n \n \"Yes, it is time for the denouncement. Tell me, you feel that now you are through? You have fulfilled your function?\"\n \n \"Yes. Yes.\"\n \n \"Now you will have but to lean back, as it were, so to speak, and see me suffer?\"\n \n \" Yes. \"\n \n \"No. Can't do it, old man. Can't. I know. You're too human, too like me. The one thing a man can't accept is a passive state, a state of uselessness. Not if he can possibly avoid it. Something has to be happening to him. He has to be happening to something. You didn't kill me because then you would have nothing left to do. You'll never kill me.\"\n \n \"Of course not!\" Victor stormed. \"Fundamental safety cut-off!\"\n \n \"Rationalization. You don't want to kill me. And you can't stop challenging me at every turn. That's your function.\"\n \n \"Stop talking and just think about your miserable life,\" Victor said meanly. \"Your friends won't grow and mature with you. You won't make any new friends. You'll have me to constantly remind you of your uselessness, your constant unrelenting sterility of purpose. How's that for boredom, for passiveness?\"\n \n \"That's what I'm trying to tell you,\" Manet said irritably, his social manners rusty. \"I won't be bored. You will see to that. It's your purpose. You'll be a challenge, an obstacle, a source of triumph every foot of the way. Don't you see? With you for an enemy, I don't need a friend!\"", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "50818", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

HARRIS\n \n In language translation, you may get a literally accurate word-for-word translation ... but miss the meaning entirely. And in space-type translation ... the effect may be the same!\n \n\n Illustrated by Schoenherr\n \n\n \n The cell had been put together more efficiently than any Korvin had ever been in. But that was only natural, he told himself sadly; the Tr'en were an efficient people. All the preliminary reports had agreed on that; their efficiency, as a matter of fact, was what had made Korvin's arrival a necessity. They were well into the atomic era, and were on the verge of developing space travel. Before long they'd be settling the other planets of their system, and then the nearer stars. Faster-than-light travel couldn't be far away, for the magnificently efficient physical scientists of the Tr'en—and that would mean, in the ordinary course of events, an invitation to join the Comity of Planets.\n \n An invitation, the Comity was sure, which the Tr'en would not accept.\n \n Korvin stretched out on the cell's single bunk, a rigid affair which was hardly meant for comfort, and sighed. He'd had three days of isolation, with nothing to do but explore the resources of his own mind. He'd tried some of the ancient Rhine experiments, but that was no good; he still didn't show any particular psi talents. He couldn't unlock the cell door with his unaided mind; he couldn't even alter the probability of a single dust-mote's Brownian path through the somewhat smelly air. Nor could he disappear from his cell and appear, as if by magic, several miles away near the slightly-damaged hulk of his ship, to the wonder and amazement of his Tr'en captors.\n \n He could do, as a matter of fact, precisely nothing. He wished quietly that the Tr'en had seen fit to give him a pack of cards, or a book, or even a folder of tourist pictures. The Wonders of Tr'en, according to all the advance reports, were likely to be pretty boring, but they'd have been better than nothing.\n \n In any decently-run jail, he told himself with indignation, there would at least have been other prisoners to talk to. But on Tr'en Korvin was all alone.\n \n True, every night the guards came in and gave him a concentrated lesson in the local language, but Korvin failed to get much pleasure out of that, being unconscious at the time. But now he was equipped to discuss almost anything from philosophy to plumbing, but there was nobody to discuss it with. He changed position on the bunk and stared at the walls. The Tr'en were efficient; there weren't even any imperfections in the smooth surface to distract him.\n \n He wasn't tired and he wasn't hungry; his captors had left him with a full stock of food concentrates.\n \n But he was almightily bored, and about ready to tell anything to anyone, just for the chance at a little conversation.\n \n As he reached this dismal conclusion, the cell door opened. Korvin got up off the bunk in a hurry and spun around to face his visitor.\n \n The Tr'en was tall, and slightly green.\n \n He looked, as all the Tr'en did, vaguely humanoid—that is, if you don't bother to examine him closely. Life in the universe appeared to be rigidly limited to humanoid types on oxygen planets; Korvin didn't know why, and neither did anybody else. There were a lot of theories, but none that accounted for all the facts satisfactorily. Korvin really didn't care about it; it was none of his business.\n \n The Tr'en regarded him narrowly through catlike pupils. \"You are Korvin,\" he said.\n \n It was a ritual, Korvin had learned. \"You are of the Tr'en,\" he replied. The green being nodded.\n \n \"I am Didyak of the Tr'en,\" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed slightly—but no more than slightly—and came into the cell, closing the door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided quickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that his captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a small knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but there might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.\n \n \"What do you want with me?\" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech—apparently there was only one language on the planet—was stiff and slightly awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come across. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd dealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and carefully constructed than even those marvels.\n \n \"I want nothing with you,\" Didyak said, leaning against the door-frame. \"You have other questions?\"\n \n Korvin sighed. \"What are you doing here, then?\" he asked. As conversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better than solitude.\n \n \"I am leaning against the door,\" Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist approach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard to get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a second.\n \n \"Why did you come to me?\" he said at last.\n \n Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving as it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly pointed. Korvin stared back impassively. \"I have been ordered to come to you,\" Didyak said, \"by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with you.\"\n \n It wasn't quite \"talk\"; that was a general word in the Tr'en language, and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: \"gain information from, by peaceful and vocal means.\" Korvin filed it away for future reference. \"Why did the Ruler not come to me?\" Korvin asked.\n \n \"The Ruler is the Ruler,\" Didyak said, slightly discomfited. \"You are to go to him. Such is his command.\"\n \n Korvin shrugged, sighed and smoothed back his hair. \"I obey the command of the Ruler,\" he said—another ritual. Everybody obeyed the command of the Ruler. If you didn't, you never had a second chance to try.\n \n But Korvin meant exactly what he'd said. He was going to obey the commands of the Ruler of the Tr'en—and remove the Tr'en threat from the rest of the galaxy forever.\n \n That, after all, was his job.\n \n \n \n The Room of the Ruler was large, square and excessively brown. The walls were dark-brown, the furnishings—a single great chair, several kneeling-benches and a small table near the chair—were light-brown, of some metallic substance, and even the drapes were tan. It was, Korvin decided, much too much of a bad idea, even when the color contrast of the Tr'en themselves were figured in.\n \n The Ruler himself, a Tr'en over seven feet tall and correspondingly broad, sat in the great chair, his four fingers tapping gently on the table near him, staring at Korvin and his guards. The guards stood on either side of their captive, looking as impassive as jade statues, six and a half feet high.\n \n Korvin wasn't attempting to escape. He wasn't pleading with the Ruler. He wasn't defying the Ruler, either. He was just answering questions.\n \n The Tr'en liked to have everything clear. They were a logical race. The Ruler had started with Korvin's race, his name, his sex—if any—and whether or not his appearance were normal for humanity.\n \n Korvin was answering the last question. \"Some men are larger than I am,\" he said, \"and some are smaller.\"\n \n \"Within what limits?\"\n \n Korvin shrugged. \"Some are over eight feet tall,\" he said, \"and others under four feet.\" He used the Tr'en measurement scale, of course; it didn't seem necessary, though, to mention that both extremes of height were at the circus-freak level. \"Then there is a group of humans,\" he went on, \"who are never more than a foot and a half in height, and usually less than that—approximately nine or ten inches. We call these children ,\" he volunteered helpfully.\n \n \"Approximately?\" the Ruler growled. \"We ask for precision here,\" he said. \"We are scientific men. We are exact.\"\n \n Korvin nodded hurriedly. \"Our race is more ... more approximate,\" he said apologetically.\n \n \"Slipshod,\" the Ruler muttered.\n \n \"Undoubtedly,\" Korvin agreed politely. \"I'll try to do the best I can for you.\"\n \n \"You will answer my questions,\" the Ruler said, \"with exactitude.\" He paused, frowning slightly. \"You landed your ship on this planet,\" he went on. \"Why?\"\n \n \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"A clumsy lie,\" the Ruler said. \"The ship crashed; our examinations prove that beyond any doubt.\"\n \n \"True,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"And it is your job to crash your ship?\" the Ruler said. \"Wasteful.\"\n \n Korvin shrugged again. \"What I say is true,\" he announced. \"Do you have tests for such matters?\"\n \n \"We do,\" the Ruler told him. \"We are an exact and a scientific race. A machine for the testing of truth has been adjusted to your physiology. It will be attached to you.\"\n \n Korvin looked around and saw it coming through the door, pushed by two technicians. It was large and squat and metallic, and it had wheels, dials, blinking lights, tubes and wires, and a seat with armrests and straps. It was obviously a form of lie-detector—and Korvin felt himself marveling again at this race. Earth science had nothing to match their enormous command of the physical universe; adapting a hypnopædic language-course to an alien being so quickly had been wonder enough, but adapting the perilously delicate mechanisms that necessarily made up any lie-detector machinery was almost a miracle. The Tr'en, under other circumstances, would have been a valuable addition to the Comity of Nations.\n \n Being what they were, though, they could only be a menace. And Korvin's appreciation of the size of that menace was growing hourly.\n \n He hoped the lie-detector had been adjusted correctly. If it showed him telling an untruth, he wasn't likely to live long, and his job—not to mention the strongest personal inclinations—demanded most strongly that he stay alive.\n \n He swallowed hard. But when the technicians forced him down into the seat, buckled straps around him, attached wires and electrodes and elastic bands to him at appropriate places and tightened some final screws, he made no resistance.\n \n \"We shall test the machine,\" the Ruler said. \"In what room are you?\"\n \n \"In the Room of the Ruler,\" Korvin said equably.\n \n \"Are you standing or sitting?\"\n \n \"I am sitting,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"Are you a chulad ?\" the Ruler asked. A chulad was a small native pet, Korvin knew, something like a greatly magnified deathwatch beetle.\n \n \"I am not,\" he said.\n \n \n \n The Ruler looked to his technicians for a signal, and nodded on receiving it. \"You will tell an untruth now,\" he said. \"Are you standing or sitting?\"\n \n \"I am standing,\" Korvin said.\n \n The technicians gave another signal. The Ruler looked, in his frowning manner, reasonably satisfied. \"The machine,\" he announced, \"has been adjusted satisfactorily to your physiology. The questioning will now continue.\"\n \n Korvin swallowed again. The test hadn't really seemed extensive enough to him. But, after all, the Tr'en knew their business, better than anyone else could know it. They had the technique and the logic and the training.\n \n He hoped they were right.\n \n The Ruler was frowning at him. Korvin did his best to look receptive.\n\"Why did you land your ship on this planet?\" the Ruler said.\n \n \"My job required it,\" Korvin said.\n \n The Ruler nodded. \"Your job is to crash your ship,\" he said. \"It is wasteful but the machines tell me it is true. Very well, then; we shall find out more about your job. Was the crash intentional?\"\n \n Korvin looked sober. \"Yes,\" he said.\n \n The Ruler blinked. \"Very well,\" he said. \"Was your job ended when the ship crashed?\" The Tr'en word, of course, wasn't ended , nor did it mean exactly that. As nearly as Korvin could make out, it meant\n\"disposed of for all time.\"\n \n \"No,\" he said.\n \n \"What else does your job entail?\" the Ruler said.\n \n Korvin decided to throw his first spoke into the wheel. \"Staying alive.\"\n \n The Ruler roared. \"Do not waste time with the obvious!\" he shouted.\n\"Do not try to trick us; we are a logical and scientific race! Answer correctly.\"\n \n \"I have told the truth,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"But it is not—not the truth we want,\" the Ruler said.\n \n Korvin shrugged. \"I replied to your question,\" he said. \"I did not know that there was more than one kind of truth. Surely the truth is the truth, just as the Ruler is the Ruler?\"\n \n \"I—\" The Ruler stopped himself in mid-roar. \"You try to confuse the Ruler,\" he said at last, in an approximation of his usual one. \"But the Ruler will not be confused. We have experts in matters of logic\"—the Tr'en word seemed to mean right-saying —\"who will advise the Ruler. They will be called.\"\n \n Korvin's guards were standing around doing nothing of importance now that their captor was strapped down in the lie-detector. The Ruler gestured and they went out the door in a hurry.\n \n The Ruler looked down at Korvin. \"You will find that you cannot trick us,\" he said. \"You will find that such fiddling\"— chulad-like Korvin translated—\"attempts will get you nowhere.\"\n \n Korvin devoutly hoped so.\n \n \n \n The experts in logic arrived shortly, and in no uncertain terms Korvin was given to understand that logical paradox was not going to confuse anybody on the planet. The barber who did, or didn't, shave himself, the secretary of the club whose members were secretaries, Achilles and the tortoise, and all the other lovely paradox-models scattered around were so much primer material for the Tr'en. \"They can be treated mathematically,\" one of the experts, a small emerald-green being, told Korvin thinly. \"Of course, you would not understand the mathematics. But that is not important. You need only understand that we cannot be confused by such means.\"\n \n \"Good,\" Korvin said.\n \n The experts blinked. \"Good?\" he said.\n \n \"Naturally,\" Korvin said in a friendly tone.\n \n The expert frowned horribly, showing all of his teeth. Korvin did his best not to react. \"Your plan is a failure,\" the expert said, \"and you call this a good thing. You can mean only that your plan is different from the one we are occupied with.\"\n \n \"True,\" Korvin said.\n \n There was a short silence. The expert beamed. He examined the indicators of the lie-detector with great care. \"What is your plan?\" he said at last, in a conspiratorial whisper.\n \n \"To answer your questions, truthfully and logically,\" Korvin said.\n \n The silence this time was even longer.\n \n \"The machine says that you tell the truth,\" the experts said at last, in a awed tone. \"Thus, you must be a traitor to your native planet. You must want us to conquer your planet, and have come here secretly to aid us.\"\n \n Korvin was very glad that wasn't a question. It was, after all, the only logical deduction.\n \n But it happened to be wrong.\n \n \n \n \"The name of your planet is Earth?\" the Ruler asked. A few minutes had passed; the experts were clustered around the single chair. Korvin was still strapped to the machine; a logical race makes use of a traitor, but a logical race does not trust him.\n \n \"Sometimes,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"It has other names?\" the Ruler said.\n \n \"It has no name,\" Korvin said truthfully. The Tr'en idiom was like the Earthly one; and certainly a planet had no name. People attached names to it, that was all. It had none of its own.\n \n \"Yet you call it Earth?\" the Ruler said.\n \n \"I do,\" Korvin said, \"for convenience.\"\n \n \"Do you know its location?\" the Ruler said.\n \n \"Not with exactitude,\" Korvin said.\n \n There was a stir. \"But you can find it again,\" the Ruler said.\n \n \"I can,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"And you will tell us about it?\" the Ruler went on.\n \n \"I will,\" Korvin said, \"so far as I am able.\"\n \n \"We will wish to know about weapons,\" the Ruler said, \"and about plans and fortifications. But we must first know of the manner of decision on this planet. Is your planet joined with others in a government or does it exist alone?\"\n \n Korvin nearly smiled. \"Both,\" he said.\n \n A short silence was broken by one of the attendant experts. \"We have theorized that an underling may be permitted to make some of his own decisions, leaving only the more extensive ones for the master. This seems to us inefficient and liable to error, yet it is a possible system. Is it the system you mean?\"\n \n Very sharp, Korvin told himself grimly. \"It is,\" he said.\n \n \"Then the government which reigns over several planets is supreme,\" the Ruler said.\n \n \"It is,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"Who is it that governs?\" the Ruler said.\n \n The key question had, at last, been asked. Korvin felt grateful that the logical Tr'en had determined to begin from the beginning, instead of going off after details of armament first; it saved a lot of time.\n \n \"The answer to that question,\" Korvin said, \"cannot be given to you.\"\n \n \"Any question of fact has an answer,\" the Ruler snapped. \"A paradox is not involved here; a government exists, and some being is the governor. Perhaps several beings share this task; perhaps machines do the work. But where there is a government, there is a governor. Is this agreed?\"\n \n \"Certainly,\" Korvin said. \"It is completely obvious and true.\"\n \n \"The planet from which you come is part of a system of planets which are governed, you have said,\" the Ruler went on.\n \n \"True,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"Then there is a governor for this system,\" the Ruler said.\n \n \"True,\" Korvin said again.\n \n The ruler sighed gently. \"Explain this governor to us,\" he said.\n \n Korvin shrugged. \"The explanation cannot be given to you.\"\n \n The Ruler turned to a group of his experts and a short muttered conversation took place. At its end the Ruler turned his gaze back to Korvin. \"Is the deficiency in you?\" he said. \"Are you in some way unable to describe this government?\"\n \n \"It can be described,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"Then you will suffer unpleasant consequences if you describe it to us?\" the Ruler went on.\n \n \"I will not,\" Korvin said.\n \n It was the signal for another conference. With some satisfaction, Korvin noticed that the Tr'en were becoming slightly puzzled; they were no longer moving and speaking with calm assurance.\n \n The plan was taking hold.\n \n The Ruler had finished his conference. \"You are attempting again to confuse us,\" he said.\n \n Korvin shook his head earnestly. \"I am attempting,\" he said, \"not to confuse you.\"\n \n \"Then I ask for an answer,\" the Ruler said.\n \n \"I request that I be allowed to ask a question,\" Korvin said.\n \n The Ruler hesitated, then nodded. \"Ask it,\" he said. \"We shall answer it if we see fit to do so.\"\n \n Korvin tried to look grateful. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what is your government?\"\n \n The Ruler beckoned to a heavy-set green being, who stepped forward from a knot of Tr'en, inclined his head in Korvin's direction, and began. \"Our government is the only logical form of government,\" he said in a high, sweet tenor. \"The Ruler orders all, and his subjects obey. In this way uniformity is gained, and this uniformity aids in the speed of possible action and in the weight of action. All Tr'en act instantly in the same manner. The Ruler is adopted by the previous Ruler; in this way we are assured of a common wisdom and a steady judgment.\"\n \n \"You have heard our government defined,\" the Ruler said. \"Now, you will define yours for us.\"\n \n Korvin shook his head. \"If you insist,\" he said, \"I'll try it. But you won't understand it.\"\n \n The Ruler frowned. \"We shall understand,\" he said. \"Begin. Who governs you?\"\n \n \"None,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"But you are governed?\"\n \n Korvin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n \n \"Then there is a governor,\" the Ruler insisted.\n \n \"True,\" Korvin said. \"But everyone is the governor.\"\n \n \"Then there is no government,\" the Ruler said. \"There is no single decision.\"\n \n \"No,\" Korvin said equably, \"there are many decisions binding on all.\"\n \n \"Who makes them binding?\" the Ruler asked. \"Who forces you to accept these decisions? Some of them must be unfavorable to some beings?\"\n \n \"Many of them are unfavorable,\" Korvin said. \"But we are not forced to accept them.\"\n \n \"Do you act against your own interests?\"\n \n Korvin shrugged. \"Not knowingly,\" he said. The Ruler flashed a look at the technicians handling the lie-detector. Korvin turned to see their expression. They needed no words; the lie-detector was telling them, perfectly obviously, that he was speaking the truth. But the truth wasn't making any sense. \"I told you you wouldn't understand it,\" he said.\n \n \"It is a defect in your explanation,\" the Ruler almost snarled.\n \n \"My explanation is as exact as it can be,\" he said.\n \n The Ruler breathed gustily. \"Let us try something else,\" he said.\n\"Everyone is the governor. Do you share a single mind? A racial mind has been theorized, though we have met with no examples—\"\n \n \"Neither have we,\" Korvin said. \"We are all individuals, like yourselves.\"\n \n \"But with no single ruler to form policy, to make decisions—\"\n \n \"We have no need of one,\" Korvin said calmly.\n \n \"Ah,\" the Ruler said suddenly, as if he saw daylight ahead. \"And why not?\"\n \n \"We call our form of government democracy ,\" Korvin said. \"It means the rule of the people. There is no need for another ruler.\"\n \n One of the experts piped up suddenly. \"The beings themselves rule each other?\" he said. \"This is clearly impossible; for, no one being can have the force to compel acceptance of his commands. Without his force, there can be no effective rule.\"\n \n \"That is our form of government,\" Korvin said.\n \n \"You are lying,\" the expert said.\n \n One of the technicians chimed in: \"The machine tells us—\"\n \n \"Then the machine is faulty,\" the expert said. \"It will be corrected.\"\n \n Korvin wondered, as the technicians argued, how long they'd take studying the machine, before they realized it didn't have any defects to correct. He hoped it wasn't going to be too long; he could foresee another stretch of boredom coming. And, besides, he was getting homesick.\n \n It took three days—but boredom never really had a chance to set in. Korvin found himself the object of more attention than he had hoped for; one by one, the experts came to his cell, each with a different method of resolving the obvious contradictions in his statements.\n \n Some of them went away fuming. Others simply went away, puzzled.\n \n On the third day Korvin escaped.\n \n It wasn't very difficult; he hadn't thought it would be. Even the most logical of thinking beings has a subconscious as well as a conscious mind, and one of the ways of dealing with an insoluble problem is to make the problem disappear. There were only two ways of doing that, and killing the problem's main focus was a little more complicated. That couldn't be done by the subconscious mind; the conscious had to intervene somewhere. And it couldn't.\n \n Because that would mean recognizing, fully and consciously, that the problem was insoluble. And the Tr'en weren't capable of that sort of thinking.\n \n Korvin thanked his lucky stars that their genius had been restricted to the physical and mathematical. Any insight at all into the mental sciences would have given them the key to his existence, and his entire plan, within seconds.\n \n But, then, it was lack of that insight that had called for this particular plan. That, and the political structure of the Tr'en.\n \n The same lack of insight let the Tr'en subconscious work on his escape without any annoying distractions in the way of deep reflection. Someone left a door unlocked and a weapon nearby—all quite intent, Korvin was sure. Getting to the ship was a little more complicated, but presented no new problems; he was airborne, and then space-borne, inside of a few hours after leaving the cell.\n \n He set his course, relaxed, and cleared his mind. He had no psionic talents, but the men at Earth Central did; he couldn't receive messages, but he could send them. He sent one now.\n  Mission accomplished; the Tr'en aren't about to come marauding out into space too soon. They've been given food for thought—nice indigestible food that's going to stick in their craws until they finally manage to digest it. But they can't digest it and stay what they are; you've got to be democratic, to some extent, to understand the idea. What keeps us obeying laws we ourselves make? What keeps us obeying laws that make things inconvenient for us? Sheer self-interest, of course—but try to make a Tr'en see it!\n \n  With one government and one language, they just weren't equipped for translation. They were too efficient physically to try for the mental sciences at all. No mental sciences, no insight into my mind or their own—and that means no translation.\n \n  But—damn it—I wish I were home already.\n \n  I'm bored absolutely stiff!\n \n\n THE END", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "30029", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

{"doc_id": "42ccd388477c4aabbd8cde73b58e97d8", "text": "THE SOUL EATERS\n \n\n By WILLIAM CONOVER\n \n \n Firebrand Dennis Brooke had one final chance to redeem himself by capturing Koerber whose ships were the scourge of the Void. But his luck had run its course, and now he was marooned on a rogue planet—fighting to save himself from a menace weapons could not kill.\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Fall 1944. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n \" And so, my dear ,\" Dennis detected a faint irony in the phrase, \" I'm afraid I can offer no competition to the beauties of five planets—or is it six? With regret I bow myself out, and knowing me as you do, you'll understand the futility of trying to convince me again. Anyway, there will be no temptation, for I'm sailing on a new assignment I've accepted. I did love you.... Good-by. \"\n \n Dennis Brooke had lost count of the times he'd read Marla's last letter, but every time he came to these final, poignant lines, they never failed to conjure a vision of her tawny loveliness, slender as the palms of Venus, and of the blue ecstasy of her eyes, wide with a perpetual wonder—limpid as a child's.\n \n The barbaric rhythms of the Congahua , were a background of annoyance in Dennis' mind; he frowned slightly as the maneuvers of the Mercurian dancer, who writhed among the guests of the notorious pleasure palace, began to leave no doubt as to her intentions. The girl was beautiful, in a sultry, almost incandescent sort of way, but her open promise left him cold. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts in silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not to speak of his career. But Venus, in the throes of a gigantic boom upon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one solitude—the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n \n Dennis Brooke was thirty, the time when youth no longer seems unending. When the minor adventures of the heart begin to pall. If the loss of Marla left an aching void that all the women of five planets could not fill, the loss of Space, was quite as deadly. For he had been grounded. True, Koerber's escape from the I.S.P. net had not quite been his fault; but had he not been enjoying the joys of a voluptuous Jovian Chamber, in Venus' fabulous Inter-planetary Palace, he would have been ready for duty to complete the last link in the net of I.S.P. cruisers that almost surrounded the space pirate.\n \n A night in the Jovian Chamber, was to be emperor for one night. Every dream of a man's desire was marvelously induced through the skilful use of hypnotics; the rarest viands and most delectable drinks appeared as if by magic; the unearthly peace of an Olympus descended on a man's soul, and beauty ... beauty such as men dreamed of was a warm reality under the ineffable illumination of the Chamber.\n \n It cost a young fortune. But to pleasure mad, boom-ridden Venus, a fortune was a bagatelle. Only it had cost Dennis Brooke far more than a sheaf of credits—it had cost him the severe rebuff of the I.S.P., and most of his heart in Marla.\n \n Dennis sighed, he tilted his red, curly head and drank deeply of the insidious Verbena , fragrant as a mint garden, in the tall frosty glass of Martian Bacca-glas , and as he did so, his brilliant hazel eyes found themselves gazing into the unwinking, violet stare of a young Martian at the next table. There was a smouldering hatred in those eyes, and something else ... envy, perhaps, or was it jealousy? Dennis couldn't tell. But his senses became instantly alert. Danger brought a faint vibration which his superbly trained faculties could instantly denote.\n \n His steady, bronzed hand lowered the drink, and his eyes narrowed slightly. Absorbed in trying to puzzle the sudden enmity of this Martian stranger, he was unaware of the Mercurian Dancer. The latter had edged closer, whirling in prismatic flashes from the myriad semi-precious stones that studded her brief gauze skirt. And now, in a final bid for the spacer's favor she flung herself in his lap and tilted back invitingly.\n \n Some of the guests laughed, others stared in plain envy at the handsome, red-haired spacer, but from the table across, came the tinkling sound of a fragile glass being crushed in a powerful hand, and a muffled Martian curse. Without warning, the Martian was on his feet with the speed of an Hellacorium, the table went crashing to one side as he leaped with deadly intent on the sprawled figure of Dennis Brooke. A high-pitched scream brought instant silence as a Terran girl cried out. Then the Martian's hand reached out hungrily. But Dennis was not there.\n \n \n\n \n Leaping to one side, impervious to the fall of the dancer, he avoided the murderous rush of the Martian youth, then he wheeled swiftly and planted a sledge-hammer blow in that most vulnerable spot of all Martians, the spot just below their narrow, wasp-like waist, and as the Martian half-doubled over, he lefted him with a short jab to the chin that staggered and all but dropped him.\n \n The Martian's violet eyes were black with fury now. He staggered back and sucked in air, his face contorted with excruciating pain. But he was not through. His powerful right shot like a blast straight for Dennis' chest, striking like a piston just below the heart. Dennis took it, flat-footed, without flinching; then he let his right ride over with all the force at his command. It caught the Martian on the jaw and spun him like a top, the pale, imperious face went crimson as he slowly sagged to his knees and rolled to the impeccable mosaics of the floor.\n \n Dennis, breathing heavily, stood over him until the international police arrived, and then he had the surprise of his life. Upon search, the police found a tiny, but fatal silvery tube holstered under his left arm-pit—an atomic-disintegrator, forbidden throughout the interplanetary League. Only major criminals and space pirates still without the law were known to possess them.\n \n \"Looks like your brawl has turned out to be a piece of fool's luck, Brooke!\" The Police Lieutenant favored Dennis with a wry smile. \"If I'm not mistaken this chap's a member of Bren Koerber's pirate crew. Who else could afford to risk his neck at the International, and have in his possession a disintegrator? Pity we have no complete records on that devil's crew! Anyway, we'll radio the I.S.P., perhaps they have details on this dandy!\" He eyed admiringly the priceless Martian embroideries on the unconscious Martian's tunic, the costly border of red, ocelandian fur, and the magnificent black acerine on his finger.\n \n Dennis Brooke shrugged his shoulders, shoulders that would have put to shame the Athenian statues of another age. A faint, bitter smile curved his generous mouth. \"I'm grounded, Gillian, it'd take the capture of Koerber himself to set me right with the I.S.P. again—you don't know Bertram! To him an infraction of rules is a major crime. Damn Venus!\" He reached for his glass of Verbena but the table had turned over during the struggle, and the glass was a shattered mass of gleaming Bacca-glas shards. He laughed shortly as he became conscious of the venomous stare of the Mercurian Dancer, of the excited voices of the guests and the emphatic disapproval of the Venusian proprietor who was shocked at having a brawl in his ultra-expensive, ultra-exclusive Palace.\n \n \"Better come to Headquarters with me, Dennis,\" the lieutenant said gently. \"We'll say you captured him, and if he's Koerber's, the credit's yours. A trip to Terra's what you need, Venus for you is a hoodoo!\"\n \n \n\n \n The stern, white haired I.S.P. Commander behind the immense Aluminil desk, frowned slightly as Dennis Brooke entered. He eyed the six foot four frame of the Captain before him with a mixture of feelings, as if uncertain how to begin. Finally, he sighed as if, having come to a decision, he were forcing himself to speak:\n \n \"Sit down, Dennis. I've sent for you, despite your grounding, for two reasons. The first one you already know—your capture of one of Koerber's henchmen—has given us a line as to his present orbit of piracy, and the means of a check on his activities. But that's not really why I've brought you here.\" He frowned again as if what he had to say were difficult indeed.\n \n \"Marla Starland, your fiancee, accepted an assignment we offered her—a delicate piece of work here on Terra that only a very beautiful, and very clever young lady could perform. And,\" he paused, grimacing,\n\"somewhere between Venus and Terra, the interplanetary spacer bringing her and several other passengers, began to send distress signals. Finally, we couldn't contact the ship any more. It is three days overdue. All passengers, a cargo of radium from Venus worth untold millions, the spacer itself—seem to have vanished.\"\n \n Dennis Brooke's space-tanned features had gone pale. His large hazel eyes, fringed with auburn lashes, too long for a man, were bright slits that smouldered. He stood silent, his hands clenched at his sides, while something cold and sharp seemed to dig at his heart with cruel precision.\n \n \"Marla!\" He breathed at last. The thought of Marla in the power of Koerber sent a wave of anguish that seared through him like an atom-blast.\n \n \"Commander,\" Dennis said, and his rich baritone voice had depths of emotion so great that they startled Commander Bertram himself—and that grizzled veteran of the I.S.P., had at one time or another known every change of torture that could possibly be wrung on a human soul.\n\"Commander, give me one ... one chance at that spawn of unthinkable begetting! Let me try, and I promise you ...\" in his torture, Dennis was unconsciously banging a knotted fist on the chaste, satiny surface of the priceless desk, \"I promise you that I will either bring you Koerber, or forfeit my life!\"\n \n Commander Bertram nodded his head. \"I brought you here for that purpose, son. We have reached a point in our war with Koerber, where the last stakes must be played ... and the last stake is death!\"\n \n He reached over and flipped up the activator on a small telecast set on his desk; instantly the viso-screen lighted up. \"You'll now see a visual record of all we know about the passenger spacer that left Venus with passengers and cargo, as far as we could contact the vessel in space. This, Dennis,\" the Commander emphasized his words, \"is your chance to redeem yourself!\" He fell silent, while the viso-screen began to show a crowded space port on Venus, and a gigantic passenger spacer up-tilted in its cradle.\n \n \n\n \n They watched the parabola it made in its trajectory as it flashed into space and then fell into orbit there beyond the planetary attraction of Venus. On the three-dimensional viso-screen it was uncannily real.\n \n A flight that had taken many hours to accomplish, was shortened on the viso-screen to a matter of minutes. They saw the great, proud interplanetary transport speeding majestically through the starry void, and suddenly, they saw her swerve in a great arc; again she swerved as if avoiding something deadly in space, and point upwards gaining altitude. It was zig-zagging now, desperately maneuvering in an erratic course, and as if by magic, a tiny spot appeared on the transport's side.\n \n Tiny on the viso-screen, the fatal spots must have been huge in actuality. To the Commander of the I.S.P., and to Captain Brooke, it was an old story. Atom-blasts were pitting the spacer's hull with deadly Genton shells. The great transport trembled under the impact of the barrage, and suddenly, the screen went blank.\n \n Commander Bertram turned slowly to face the young I.S.P. captain, whose features were a mask devoid of all expression now, save for the pallor and the burning fire in his eyes.\n \n \"And that's the sixth one in a month. Sometimes the survivors reach Terra in emergency spacers, or are picked up in space by other transports ... and sometimes son ... well, as you know, sometimes they're never seen again.\"\n \n \"When do I leave, Commander!\" Dennis Brooke's voice was like a javelin of ice.\n \n \"Right now, if you wish. We have a new cruiser armored in beryloid with double hull—a new design against Genton shells, but it's the speed of the thing that you'll want to know about. It just about surpasses anything ever invented. Get the figures and data from the coordination room, son; it's serviced and fueled and the crew's aboard.\" He extended his hand. \"You're the best spacer we have—aside from your recklessness—and on your success depends far more than the capture of an outlaw.\" Bertram smiled thinly. \"Happy landing!\"\n \n \n\n II\n \n Their nerves were ragged. Days and days of fruitless search for a phantom ship that seemed to have vanished from space, and an equally elusive pirate whose whereabouts were hidden in the depths of fathomless space.\n \n To all but Captain Brooke, this was a new adventure, their first assignment to duty in a search that went beyond the realm of the inner planets, where men spent sleepless nights in eternal vigilance against stray asteroids and outlaw crews of ruthless vandal ships. Even their cruiser was a new experience, the long, tapering fighter lacked the luxurious offices and appointments of the regular I.S.P. Patrol spacers. It placed a maximum on speed, and all available space was hoarded for fuel. The lightning fast tiger of the space-lanes, was a thing of beauty, but of grim, sleek beauty instinct with power, not the comfortable luxury that they knew.\n \n Day after day they went through their drills, donning space suits, manning battle stations; aiming deadly atom-cannon at empty space, and eternally scanning the vast empty reaches by means of the telecast.\n \n And suddenly, out of the void, as they had all but given up the search as a wild goose chase, a speck was limned in the lighted surface of the viso-screen in the control room. Instantly the I.S.P. cruiser came to life. In a burst of magnificent speed, the cruiser literally devoured the space leagues, until the spacer became a flashing streak. On the viso-screen, the speck grew larger, took on contours, growing and becoming slowly the drifting shell of what had been a transport.\n \n Presently they were within reaching distance, and Captain Brooke commanded through the teleradio from the control room:\n \n \"Prepare to board!\"\n \n Every member of the crew wanted to be among the boarding party, for all but George Randall, the junior member of the crew had served his apprenticeship among the inner planets, Mars, Venus and Terra. He felt nauseated at the very thought of going out there in that vast abyss of space. His young, beardless face, with the candid blue eyes went pale when the order was given. But presently, Captain Brooke named those who were to go beside himself:\n \n \"You, Tom and Scotty, take one emergency plane, and Dallas!\"\n \n \"Yes, Captain!\" Dallas Bernan, the immense third lieutenant boomed in his basso-profundo voice.\n \n \"You and I'll take a second emergency!\" There was a pause in the voice of the Captain from the control room, then: \"Test space suits. Test oxygen helmets! Atom-blasts only, ready in five minutes!\"\n \n George Randall breathed a sigh of relief. He watched them bridge the space to the drifting wreck, then saw them enter what had once been a proud interplanetary liner, now soon to be but drifting dust, and he turned away with a look of shame.\n \n Inside the liner, Captain Dennis Brooke had finished making a detailed survey.\n \n \"No doubt about it,\" he spoke through the radio in his helmet. \"Cargo missing. No survivors. No indication that the repulsion fields were out of order. And finally, those Genton shells could only have been fired by Koerber!\" He tried to maintain a calm exterior, but inwardly he seethed in a cold fury more deadly than any he had ever experienced. Somehow he had expected to find at least one compartment unharmed, where life might have endured, but now, all hope was gone. Only a great resolve to deal with Koerber once and for all remained to him.\n \n Dennis tried not to think of Marla, too great an ache was involved in thinking of her and all he had lost. When he finally spoke, his voice was harsh, laconic:\n \n \"Prepare to return!\"\n \n Scotty Byrnes, the cruiser's nurse, who could take his motors through a major battle, or hell and high water and back again, for that matter, shifted the Venusian weed that made a perpetual bulge on his cheek and gazed curiously at Captain Brooke. They all knew the story in various versions, and with special additions. But they were spacemen, implicit in their loyalty, and with Dennis Brooke they could and did feel safe.\n \n Tom Jeffery, the tall, angular and red-faced Navigator, whose slow, easygoing movements belied the feral persistence of a tiger, and the swiftness of a striking cobra in a fight, led the small procession of men toward the emergency planes. Behind him came Dallas Bernan, third lieutenant, looming like a young asteroid in his space suit, followed by Scotty, and finally Captain Brooke himself. All left in silence, as if the tragedy that had occurred aboard the wrecked liner, had touched them intimately.\n \n \n\n \n Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser, a surprise awaited them. It was young George Randall, whose excited face met them as soon as they had entered the airlocks and removed the space suits.\n \n \"Captain Brooke ... Captain, recordings are showing on the new 'Jet Analyzers' must be the trail of some spacer. Can't be far!\" He was fairly dancing in his excitement, as if the marvelous work of the new invention that detected the disturbance of atomic jets at great distance were his own achievement.\n \n Dennis Brooke smiled. His own heart was hammering, and inwardly he prayed that it were Koerber. It had to be! No interplanetary passenger spacer could possibly be out here at the intersection of angles Kp\n39 degrees, 12 minutes, Fp 67 degrees of Ceres elliptic plane. None but a pirate crew with swift battle cruisers could dare! This was the dangerous asteroid belt, where even planetoids drifted in eccentric uncharted orbits.\n \n Dennis, Tom Jeffery and Scotty Byrnes raced to the control room, followed by the ponderous Dallas to whom hurry in any form was anathema. There could be no doubt now! The \"Jet Analyzer\" recorded powerful disturbance, atomic—could be nothing else.\n \n Instantly Captain Brooke was at the inter-communication speaker:\n \n \"Crew, battle stations! Engine room, full speed!\"\n \n Scotty Byrnes was already dashing to the engine room, where his beloved motors purred with an ascending hum. Aboard the I.S.P. Cruiser each member of the crew raced to his assigned task without delay. Action impended, and after days and nights of inertia, it was a blessed relief. Smiles appeared on haggard faces, and the banter of men suddenly galvanized by a powerful incentive was bandied back and forth. All but George Randall. Now that action was imminent. Something gripped his throat until he could hardly stand the tight collar of his I.S.P. uniform. A growing nausea gripped his bowels, and although he strove to keep calm, his hands trembled beyond control.\n \n In the compact, super-armored control room, Captain Brooke watched the telecast's viso-screen, with hungry eyes that were golden with anticipation. It seemed to him as if an eternity passed before at last, a black speck danced on the illuminated screen, until it finally reached the center of the viso-screen and remained there. It grew by leaps and bounds as the terrific speed of the cruiser minimized the distance long before the quarry was aware of pursuit.\n \n But at last, when the enemy cruiser showed on the viso-screen, unmistakably for what it was—a pirate craft, it showed by its sudden maneuver that it had detected the I.S.P. cruiser. For it had described a parabola in space and headed for the dangerous asteroid belt. As if navigated by a masterly hand that knew each and every orbit of the asteroids, it plunged directly into the asteroid drift, hoping to lose the I.S.P. cruiser with such a maneuver. Ordinarily, it would have succeeded, no I.S.P. patrol ship would have dared to venture into such a trap without specific orders. But to Dennis Brooke, directing the chase from the control room, even certain death was welcome, if only he could take Koerber with him.\n \n Weaving through the deadly belt for several hours, Dennis saw his quarry slow down. Instantly he seized the chance and ordered a salvo from starboard. Koerber's powerful spacer reeled, dived and came up spewing Genton-shells. The battle was on at last.\n \n From the banked atom-cannon of the I.S.P. Cruiser, a deadly curtain of atomic fire blazed at the pirate craft. A ragged rent back toward midship showed on Koerber's Cruiser which trembled as if it had been mortally wounded. Then Dennis maneuvered his cruiser into a power dive as a rain of Genton-shells swept the space lane above him, but as he came up, a lone shell struck. At such close range, super-armor was ripped, second armor penetrated and the magnificent vessel shook under the detonating impact.\n \n It was then that Dennis Brooke saw the immense dark shadow looming immediately behind Koerber's ship. He saw the pirate cruiser zoom desperately in an effort to break the gravity trap of the looming mass, but too late. It struggled like a fly caught in a spider-web to no avail. It was then that Koerber played his last card. Sensing he was doomed, he tried to draw the I.S.P. Cruiser down with him. A powerful magnetic beam lashed out to spear the I.S.P. Cruiser.\n \n \n\n \n With a wrenching turn that almost threw them out of control, Dennis maneuvered to avoid the beam. Again Koerber's beam lashed out, as he sank lower into the looming mass, and again Dennis anticipating the maneuver avoided it.\n \n \"George Randall!\" He shouted desperately into the speaker. \"Cut all jets in the rocket room! Hurry, man!\" He banked again and then zoomed out of the increasing gravity trap.\n \n \"Randall! I've got to use the magnetic repulsion plates.... Cut all the jets!\" But there was no response. Randall's screen remained blank. Then Koerber's lashing magnetic beam touched and the I.S.P. ship was caught, forced to follow the pirate ship's plunge like the weight at the end of a whiplash. Koerber's gunners sent one parting shot, an atom-blast that shook the trapped cruiser like a leaf.\n \n Beneath them, growing larger by the second, a small world rushed up to meet them. The readings in the Planetograph seemed to have gone crazy. It showed diameter 1200 miles; composition mineral and radio-active. Gravity seven-eighths of Terra. It couldn't be! Unless perhaps this unknown planetoid was the legendary core of the world that at one time was supposed to have existed between Jupiter and Mars. Only that could possibly explain the incredible gravity.\n \n And then began another type of battle. Hearing the Captain's orders to Randall, and noting that no result had been obtained, Scotty Byrnes himself cut the jets. The Magnetic Repulsion Plates went into action, too late to save them from being drawn, but at least they could prevent a crash. Far in the distance they could see Koerber's ship preceding them in a free fall, then the Planetoid was rushing up to engulf them.\n \n \n\n III\n \n The atmosphere was somewhat tenuous, but it was breathable, provided a man didn't exert himself. To the silent crew of the I.S.P. Cruiser, the strange world to which Koerber's magnetic Beam had drawn them, was anything but reassuring. Towering crags jutted raggedly against the sky, and the iridescent soil of the narrow valley that walled in the cruiser, had a poisonous, deadly look. As far as their eyes could reach, the desolate, denuded vista stretched to the horizon.\n \n \"Pretty much of a mess!\" Dennis Brooke's face was impassive as he turned to Scotty Byrnes. \"What's your opinion? Think we can patch her up, or are we stuck here indefinitely?\"\n \n Scotty eyed the damage. The atom-blast had penetrated the hull into the forward fuel chambers and the armor had blossomed out like flower petals. The crash-landing had not helped either.\n \n \"Well, there's a few beryloid plates in the storage locker, Captain, but,\" he scratched his head ruminatively and shifted his precious cud.\n \n \"But what? Speak up man!\" It was Tom Jeffery, his nerves on edge, his ordinarily gentle voice like a lash.\n \n \"But, you may as well know it,\" Scotty replied quietly. \"That parting shot of Koerber's severed our main rocket feed. I had to use the emergency tank to make it down here!\"\n \n For a long moment the four men looked at each other in silence. Dennis Brooke's face was still impassive but for the flaming hazel eyes. Tom tugged at the torn sleeve of his I.S.P. uniform, while Scotty gazed mournfully at the damaged ship. Dallas Bernan looked at the long, ragged line of cliffs.\n \n \"I think we got Koerber, though,\" he said at last. \"While Tom was doing a job of navigation, I had one last glimpse of him coming down fast and out of control somewhere behind those crags over there!\"\n \n \"To hell with Koerber!\" Tom Jeffery exploded. \"You mean we're stuck in this hellish rock-pile?\"\n \n \"Easy, Tom!\" Captain Brooke's tones were like ice. On his pale, impassive face, his eyes were like flaming topaz. \"Where's Randall?\"\n \n \"Probably hiding his head under a bunk!\" Dallas laughed with scorn. His contemptuous remark voiced the feelings of the entire crew. A man who failed to be at his battle-station in time of emergency, had no place in the I.S.P.\n \n \"Considering the gravity of this planetoid,\" Dennis Brooke said thoughtfully, \"it's going to take some blast to get us off!\"\n \n \"Maybe we can locate a deposit of anerioum or uranium or something for our atom-busters to chew on!\" Scotty said hopefully. He was an eternal optimist.\n \n \"Better break out those repair plates,\" Dennis said to Scotty. \"Tom, you get the welders ready. I've got a few entries to make in the log book, and then we'll decide on a party to explore the terrain and try to find out what happened to Koerber's ship. I must know,\" he said in a low voice, but with such passion that the others were startled.\n \n A figure appeared in the slanting doorway of the ship in time to hear the last words. It was George Randall, adjusting a bandaged forehead bumped during the crash landing.\n \n \"Captain ... I ... I wanted ...\" he paused unable to continue.\n \n \"You wanted what?\" Captain Brooke's voice was terse. \"Perhaps you wanted to explain why you weren't at your battle station?\"\n \n \"Sir, I wanted to know if ... if I might help Scotty with the welding job....\" That wasn't at all what he'd intended to say. But somehow the words had stuck in his throat and his face flushed deep scarlet. His candid blue eyes were suspiciously brilliant, and the white bandage with its crimson stains made an appealing, boyish figure. It softened the anger in Brooke's heart. Thinking it over calmly, Dennis realized this was the youngster's first trip into the outer orbits, and better men than he had cracked in those vast reaches of space. But there had been an instant when he'd found Randall cowering in the rocket-room, in the grip of paralyzing hysteria, when he could cheerfully have wrung his neck!\n \n \"Certainly, Randall,\" he replied in a much more kindly tone. \"We'll need all hands now.\"\n \n \"Thank you, sir!\" Randall seemed to hesitate for a moment, opened his mouth to speak further, but feeling the other's calculating gaze upon him, he whirled and re-entered the ship.\n \n \"But for him we wouldn't be here!\" Dallas exclaimed. \"Aagh!\" He shook his head in disgust until the several folds of flesh under his chin shook like gelatin. \"Cowards are hell!\" He spat.\n \n \"Easy, Dallas, Randall's a kid, give 'im a chance.\" Dennis observed.\n \n \"You Captain ... you're defending 'im? Why you had a greater stake in this than we, and he's spoiled it for you!\"\n \n \"Yep,\" Dennis nodded. \"But I'm still keeping my senses clear. No feuds on my ship. Get it!\" The last two words cut like a scimitar.\n \n Dallas nodded and lowered his eyes. Scotty shifted his cud and spat a thin stream of juice over the iridescent ground. One by one they re-entered the cruiser.", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "63150", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

But I had in mind one of those charming resort\nworlds, with only an occasional visa problem, or perhaps a distressed\nspaceman or two a year. Instead, I'm zoo-keeper to these confounded\nsettlers. And not for one world, mind you, but eight!\" He stared glumly\nat Vice-Consul Retief.\n \n  \"Still,\" Retief said, \"it gives an opportunity to travel—\"\n \n  \"Travel!\" the consul barked. \"I hate travel. Here in this backwater\nsystem particularly—\" He paused, blinked at Retief and cleared his\nthroat. \"Not that a bit of travel isn't an excellent thing for a\njunior officer. Marvelous experience.\"\n \n  He turned to the wall-screen and pressed a button. A system triagram\nappeared: eight luminous green dots arranged around a larger disk\nrepresenting the primary. He picked up a pointer, indicating the\ninnermost planet.\n \n  \"The situation on Adobe is nearing crisis. The confounded settlers—a\nmere handful of them—have managed, as usual, to stir up trouble with\nan intelligent indigenous life form, the Jaq. I can't think why they\nbother, merely for a few oases among the endless deserts. However I\nhave, at last, received authorization from Sector Headquarters to\ntake certain action.\" He swung back to face Retief. \"I'm sending you\nin to handle the situation, Retief—under sealed orders.\" He picked\nup a fat buff envelope. \"A pity they didn't see fit to order the\nTerrestrial settlers out weeks ago, as I suggested. Now it is too late.\nI'm expected to produce a miracle—a rapprochement between Terrestrial\nand Adoban and a division of territory. It's idiotic. However, failure\nwould look very bad in my record, so I shall expect results.\"\n \n  He passed the buff envelope across to Retief.\n \n  \"I understood that Adobe was uninhabited,\" Retief said, \"until the\nTerrestrial settlers arrived.\"\n \n  \"Apparently, that was an erroneous impression.\" Passwyn fixed Retief\nwith a watery eye. \"You'll follow your instructions to the letter. In a\ndelicate situation such as this, there must be no impulsive, impromptu\nelement introduced. This approach has been worked out in detail at\nSector. You need merely implement it. Is that entirely clear?\"\n \n  \"Has anyone at Headquarters ever visited Adobe?\"\n \n  \"Of course not. They all hate travel. If there are no other questions,\nyou'd best be on your way. The mail run departs the dome in less than\nan hour.\"\n \n  \"What's this native life form like?\" Retief asked, getting to his feet.\n \n  \"When you get back,\" said Passwyn, \"you tell me.\"\nThe mail pilot, a leathery veteran with quarter-inch whiskers, spat\ntoward a stained corner of the compartment, leaned close to the screen.\n \n  \"They's shootin' goin' on down there,\" he said. \"See them white puffs\nover the edge of the desert?\"\n \n  \"I'm supposed to be preventing the war,\" said Retief. \"It looks like\nI'm a little late.\"\n \n  The pilot's head snapped around. \"War?\" he yelped. \"Nobody told me they\nwas a war goin' on on 'Dobe. If that's what that is, I'm gettin' out of\nhere.\"\n \n  \"Hold on,\" said Retief. \"I've got to get down. They won't shoot at you.\"\n \n  \"They shore won't, sonny. I ain't givin' 'em the chance.\" He started\npunching keys on the console. Retief reached out, caught his wrist.\n \n  \"Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I've got to get down.\"\n \n  The pilot plunged against the restraint, swung a punch that Retief\nblocked casually. \"Are you nuts?\" the pilot screeched. \"They's plenty\nshootin' goin' on fer me to see it fifty miles out.\"\n \n  \"The mail must go through, you know.\"\n \n  \"Okay! You're so dead set on gettin' killed, you take the skiff. I'll\ntell 'em to pick up the remains next trip.\"\n \n  \"You're a pal. I'll take your offer.\"\n \n  The pilot jumped to the lifeboat hatch and cycled it open. \"Get in.\nWe're closin' fast. Them birds might take it into their heads to lob\none this way....\"\n \n  Retief crawled into the narrow cockpit of the skiff, glanced over the\ncontrols. The pilot ducked out of sight, came back, handed Retief a\nheavy old-fashioned power pistol. \"Long as you're goin' in, might as\nwell take this.\"\n \n  \"Thanks.\" Retief shoved the pistol in his belt. \"I hope you're wrong.\"\n \n  \"I'll see they pick you up when the shootin's over—one way or another.\"\n \n  The hatch clanked shut. A moment later there was a jar as the skiff\ndropped away, followed by heavy buffeting in the backwash from the\ndeparting mail boat. Retief watched the tiny screen, hands on the\nmanual controls. He was dropping rapidly: forty miles, thirty-nine....\n \n  A crimson blip showed on the screen, moving out.\n \n  Retief felt sweat pop out on his forehead. The red blip meant heavy\nradiation from a warhead. Somebody was playing around with an outlawed\nbut by no means unheard of fission weapon. But maybe it was just on a\nhigh trajectory and had no connection with the skiff....\n \n  Retief altered course to the south. The blip followed.\n \n  He checked instrument readings, gripped the controls, watching. This\nwas going to be tricky. The missile bored closer. At five miles Retief\nthrew the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward the\noncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen,\ncorrecting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for no\nmore than 1000 yards.\n \n  At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past\nthe missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restraining\nharness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, and\nharmless.\n \n  Then the planetary surface was rushing up with frightening speed.\nRetief shook his head, kicked in the emergency retro-drive. Points\nof light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinary\nchemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The\nscreen flashed brilliant white, then went dark. The skiff flipped on\nits back. Smoke filled the tiny compartment. There was a series of\nshocks, a final bone-shaking concussion, then stillness, broken by the\nping of hot metal contracting.\nCoughing, Retief disengaged himself from the shock-webbing. He beat\nout sparks in his lap, groped underfoot for the hatch and wrenched it\nopen. A wave of hot jungle air struck him. He lowered himself to a bed\nof shattered foliage, got to his feet ... and dropped flat as a bullet\nwhined past his ear.\n \n  He lay listening. Stealthy movements were audible from the left.\n \n  He inched his way to the shelter of a broad-boled dwarf tree. Somewhere\na song lizard burbled. Whining insects circled, scented alien life,\nbuzzed off. There was another rustle of foliage from the underbrush\nfive yards away. A bush quivered, then a low bough dipped.\n \n  Retief edged back around the trunk, eased down behind a fallen log.\nA stocky man in grimy leather shirt and shorts appeared, moving\ncautiously, a pistol in his hand.\n \n  As he passed, Retief rose, leaped the log and tackled him.\n \n  They went down together. The stranger gave one short yell, then\nstruggled in silence. Retief flipped him onto his back, raised a fist—\n \n  \"Hey!\" the settler yelled. \"You're as human as I am!\"\n \n  \"Maybe I'll look better after a shave,\" said Retief. \"What's the idea\nof shooting at me?\"\n \n  \"Lemme up. My name's Potter. Sorry 'bout that. I figured it was a\nFlap-jack boat; looks just like 'em. I took a shot when I saw something\nmove. Didn't know it was a Terrestrial. Who are you? What you doin'\nhere? We're pretty close to the edge of the oases. That's Flap-jack\ncountry over there.\" He waved a hand toward the north, where the desert\nlay.\n \n  \"I'm glad you're a poor shot. That missile was too close for comfort.\"\n \n  \"Missile, eh? Must be Flap-jack artillery. We got nothing like that.\"\n \n  \"I heard there was a full-fledged war brewing,\" said Retief. \"I didn't\nexpect—\"\n \n  \"Good!\" Potter said. \"We figured a few of you boys from Ivory would be\njoining up when you heard. You are from Ivory?\"\n \n  \"Yes. I'm—\"\n \n  \"Hey, you must be Lemuel's cousin. Good night! I pretty near made a bad\nmistake. Lemuel's a tough man to explain something to.\"\n \n  \"I'm—\"\n \n  \"Keep your head down. These damn Flap-jacks have got some wicked hand\nweapons. Come on....\" He moved off silently on all fours. Retief\nfollowed. They crossed two hundred yards of rough country before Potter\ngot to his feet, took out a soggy bandana and mopped his face.\n \n  \"You move good for a city man. I thought you folks on Ivory just sat\nunder those domes and read dials. But I guess bein' Lemuel's cousin you\nwas raised different.\"\n \n  \"As a matter of fact—\"\n \n  \"Have to get you some real clothes, though. Those city duds don't stand\nup on 'Dobe.\"\n \n  Retief looked down at the charred, torn and sweat-soaked powder-blue\nblazer and slacks.\n \n  \"This outfit seemed pretty rough-and-ready back home,\" he said. \"But I\nguess leather has its points.\"\n \n  \"Let's get on back to camp. We'll just about make it by sundown.\nAnd, look. Don't say anything to Lemuel about me thinking you were a\nFlap-jack.\"\n \n  \"I won't, but—\"\n \n  Potter was on his way, loping off up a gentle slope. Retief pulled off\nthe sodden blazer, dropped it over a bush, added his string tie and\nfollowed Potter.\nII\n \n  \"We're damn glad you're here, mister,\" said a fat man with two\nrevolvers belted across his paunch. \"We can use every hand. We're in\nbad shape. We ran into the Flap-jacks three months ago and we haven't\nmade a smart move since. First, we thought they were a native form we\nhadn't run into before. Fact is, one of the boys shot one, thinkin' it\nwas fair game. I guess that was the start of it.\" He stirred the fire,\nadded a stick.\n \n  \"And then a bunch of 'em hit Swazey's farm here,\" Potter said. \"Killed\ntwo of his cattle, and pulled back.\"\n \n  \"I figure they thought the cows were people,\" said Swazey. \"They were\nout for revenge.\"\n \n  \"How could anybody think a cow was folks?\" another man put in. \"They\ndon't look nothin' like—\"\n \n  \"Don't be so dumb, Bert,\" said Swazey. \"They'd never seen Terries\nbefore. They know better now.\"\n \n  Bert chuckled. \"Sure do. We showed 'em the next time, didn't we,\nPotter? Got four.\"\n \n  \"They walked right up to my place a couple days after the first time,\"\nSwazey said. \"We were ready for 'em. Peppered 'em good. They cut and\nrun.\"\n \n  \"Flopped, you mean. Ugliest lookin' critters you ever saw. Look just\nlike a old piece of dirty blanket humpin' around.\"\n \n  \"It's been goin' on this way ever since. They raid and then we raid.\nBut lately they've been bringing some big stuff into it. They've got\nsome kind of pint-sized airships and automatic rifles. We've lost four\nmen now and a dozen more in the freezer, waiting for the med ship. We\ncan't afford it. The colony's got less than three hundred able-bodied\nmen.\"\n \n  \"But we're hanging onto our farms,\" said Potter. \"All these oases are\nold sea-beds—a mile deep, solid topsoil. And there's a couple of\nhundred others we haven't touched yet. The Flap-jacks won't get 'em\nwhile there's a man alive.\"\n \n  \"The whole system needs the food we can raise,\" Bert said. \"These farms\nwe're trying to start won't be enough but they'll help.\"\n \n  \"We been yellin' for help to the CDT, over on Ivory,\" said Potter. \"But\nyou know these Embassy stooges.\"\n \n  \"We heard they were sending some kind of bureaucrat in here to tell\nus to get out and give the oases to the Flap-jacks,\" said Swazey. He\ntightened his mouth. \"We're waitin' for him....\"\n \n  \"Meanwhile we got reinforcements comin' up, eh, boys?\" Bert winked at\nRetief. \"We put out the word back home. We all got relatives on Ivory\nand Verde.\"\n \n  \"Shut up, you damn fool!\" a deep voice grated.\n \n  \"Lemuel!\" Potter said. \"Nobody else could sneak up on us like that.\"\n \n  \"If I'd a been a Flap-jack; I'd of et you alive,\" the newcomer said,\nmoving into the ring of fire, a tall, broad-faced man in grimy leather.\nHe eyed Retief.\n \n  \"Who's that?\"\n \n  \"What do ya mean?\" Potter spoke in the silence. \"He's your cousin....\"\n \n  \"He ain't no cousin of mine,\" Lemuel said slowly. He stepped to Retief.\n \n  \"Who you spyin' for, stranger?\" he rasped.\nRetief got to his feet. \"I think I should explain—\"\n \n  A short-nosed automatic appeared in Lemuel's hand, a clashing note\nagainst his fringed buckskins.\n \n  \"Skip the talk. I know a fink when I see one.\"\n \n  \"Just for a change, I'd like to finish a sentence,\" said Retief. \"And I\nsuggest you put your courage back in your pocket before it bites you.\"\n \n  \"You talk too damned fancy to suit me.\"\n \n  \"Maybe. But I'm talking to suit me. Now, for the last time, put it\naway.\"\n \n  Lemuel stared at Retief. \"You givin' me orders...?\"\n \n  Retief's left fist shot out, smacked Lemuel's face dead center. He\nstumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the\ndirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met\na straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.\n \n  \"Wow!\" said Potter. \"The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!\"\n \n  \"One,\" said Swazey. \"That first one was just a love tap.\"\n \n  Bert froze. \"Hark, boys,\" he whispered. In the sudden silence a night\nlizard called. Retief strained, heard nothing. He narrowed his eyes,\npeered past the fire—\n \n  With a swift lunge he seized up the bucket of drinking water, dashed it\nover the fire, threw himself flat. He heard the others hit the dirt a\nsplit second behind him.\n \n  \"You move fast for a city man,\" breathed Swazey beside him. \"You see\npretty good too. We'll split and take 'em from two sides. You and Bert\nfrom the left, me and Potter from the right.\"\n \n  \"No,\" said Retief. \"You wait here. I'm going out alone.\"\n \n  \"What's the idea...?\"\n \n  \"Later. Sit tight and keep your eyes open.\" Retief took a bearing on a\ntreetop faintly visible against the sky and started forward.\nFive minutes' stealthy progress brought him to a slight rise of ground.\nWith infinite caution he raised himself, risking a glance over an\nout-cropping of rock.\n \n  The stunted trees ended just ahead. Beyond, he could make out the dim\ncontour of rolling desert. Flap-jack country. He got to his feet,\nclambered over the stone—still hot after a day of tropical heat—and\nmoved forward twenty yards. Around him he saw nothing but drifted sand,\npalely visible in the starlight, and the occasional shadow of jutting\nshale slabs. Behind him the jungle was still.\n \n  He sat down on the ground to wait.\n \n  It was ten minutes before a movement caught his eye. Something had\nseparated itself from a dark mass of stone, glided across a few yards\nof open ground to another shelter. Retief watched. Minutes passed. The\nshape moved again, slipped into a shadow ten feet distant. Retief felt\nthe butt of the power pistol with his elbow. His guess had better be\nright this time....\n \n  There was a sudden rasp, like leather against concrete, and a flurry of\nsand as the Flap-jack charged.\n \n  Retief rolled aside, then lunged, threw his weight on the flopping\nFlap-jack—a yard square, three inches thick at the center and all\nmuscle. The ray-like creature heaved up, curled backward, its edge\nrippling, to stand on the flattened rim of its encircling sphincter.\nIt scrabbled with prehensile fringe-tentacles for a grip on Retief's\nshoulders. He wrapped his arms around the alien and struggled to his\nfeet. The thing was heavy. A hundred pounds at least. Fighting as it\nwas, it seemed more like five hundred.\n \n  The Flap-jack reversed its tactics, went limp. Retief grabbed, felt a\nthumb slip into an orifice—\n \n  The alien went wild. Retief hung on, dug the thumb in deeper.\n \n  \"Sorry, fellow,\" he muttered between clenched teeth. \"Eye-gouging isn't\ngentlemanly, but it's effective....\"\n \n  The Flap-jack fell still, only its fringes rippling slowly. Retief\nrelaxed the pressure of his thumb; the alien gave a tentative jerk; the\nthumb dug in.\n \n  The alien went limp again, waiting.\n \n  \"Now we understand each other,\" said Retief. \"Take me to your leader.\"\nTwenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampart\nof thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terry\nforays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the\nFlap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his\nback, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation\nwas correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....\n \n  A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off.\nHe got to his feet. The captive Flap-jack rippled its fringe in an\nagitated way. Retief tensed his thumb in the eye-socket.\n \n  \"Sit tight,\" he said. \"Don't try to do anything hasty....\" His remarks\nwere falling on deaf ears—or no ears at all—but the thumb spoke as\nloudly as words.\n \n  There was a slither of sand. Another. He became aware of a ring of\npresences drawing closer.\n \n  Retief tightened his grip on the alien. He could see a dark shape now,\nlooming up almost to his own six-three. It looked like the Flap-jacks\ncame in all sizes.\n \n  A low rumble sounded, like a deep-throated growl. It strummed on, faded\nout. Retief cocked his head, frowning.\n \n  \"Try it two octaves higher,\" he said.\n \n  \"Awwrrp! Sorry. Is that better?\" a clear voice came from the darkness.\n \n  \"That's fine,\" Retief said. \"I'm here to arrange a prisoner exchange.\"\n \n  \"Prisoners? But we have no prisoners.\"\n \n  \"Sure you have. Me. Is it a deal?\"\n \n  \"Ah, yes, of course. Quite equitable. What guarantees do you require?\"\n \n  \"The word of a gentleman is sufficient.\" Retief released the alien. It\nflopped once, disappeared into the darkness.\n \n  \"If you'd care to accompany me to our headquarters,\" the voice said,\n\"we can discuss our mutual concerns in comfort.\"\n \n  \"Delighted.\"\n \n  Red lights blinked briefly. Retief glimpsed a gap in the thorny\nbarrier, stepped through it. He followed dim shapes across warm sand to\na low cave-like entry, faintly lit with a reddish glow.\n \n  \"I must apologize for the awkward design of our comfort-dome,\" said the\nvoice. \"Had we known we would be honored by a visit—\"\n \n  \"Think nothing of it,\" Retief said. \"We diplomats are trained to crawl.\"\n \n  Inside, with knees bent and head ducked under the five-foot ceiling,\nRetief looked around at the walls of pink-toned nacre, a floor like\nburgundy-colored glass spread with silken rugs and a low table of\npolished red granite that stretched down the center of the spacious\nroom, set out with silver dishes and rose-crystal drinking-tubes.\nIII\n \n  \"Let me congratulate you,\" the voice said.\n \n  Retief turned. An immense Flap-jack, hung with crimson trappings,\nrippled at his side. The voice issued from a disk strapped to its back.\n\"You fight well. I think we will find in each other worthy adversaries.\"\n \n  \"Thanks. I'm sure the test would be interesting, but I'm hoping we can\navoid it.\"\n \n  \"Avoid it?\" Retief heard a low humming coming from the speaker in the\nsilence. \"Well, let us dine,\" the mighty Flap-jack said at last. \"We\ncan resolve these matters later. I am called Hoshick of the Mosaic of\nthe Two Dawns.\"\n \n  \"I'm Retief.\" Hoshick waited expectantly, \"... of the Mountain of Red\nTape,\" Retief added.\n \n  \"Take place, Retief,\" said Hoshick. \"I hope you won't find our rude\ncouches uncomfortable.\" Two other large Flap-jacks came into the room,\ncommuned silently with Hoshick. \"Pray forgive our lack of translating\ndevices,\" he said to Retief. \"Permit me to introduce my colleagues....\"\n \n  A small Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray\nladen with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the\ndrinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.\n \n  \"I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,\" said Hoshick. \"Our\nmetabolisms are much alike, I believe.\" Retief tried the food. It had a\ndelicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau\nd'Yquem.\n \n  \"It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,\"\nsaid Hoshick. \"I confess at first we took you for an indigenous\nearth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.\" He\nraised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief\nreturned the salute and drank.\n \n  \"Of course,\" Hoshick continued, \"as soon as we realized that you were\nsportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a\nbit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a\nfew trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate\nshow. Or so I hope.\"\n \n  \"Additional skirmishers?\" said Retief. \"How many, if you don't mind my\nasking?\"\n \n  \"For the moment, perhaps only a few hundred. There-after ... well,\nI'm sure we can arrange that between us. Personally I would prefer a\ncontest of limited scope. No nuclear or radiation-effect weapons. Such\na bore, screening the spawn for deviations. Though I confess we've come\nupon some remarkably useful sports. The rangerform such as you made\ncaptive, for example. Simple-minded, of course, but a fantastically\nkeen tracker.\"\n \n  \"Oh, by all means,\" Retief said. \"No atomics. As you pointed out,\nspawn-sorting is a nuisance, and then too, it's wasteful of troops.\"\n \n  \"Ah, well, they are after all expendable. But we agree: no atomics.\nHave you tried the ground-gwack eggs? Rather a specialty of my\nMosaic....\"\n \n  \"Delicious,\" said Retief. \"I wonder. Have you considered eliminating\nweapons altogether?\"\nA scratchy sound issued from the disk. \"Pardon my laughter,\" Hoshick\nsaid, \"but surely you jest?\"\n \n  \"As a matter of fact,\" said Retief, \"we ourselves seldom use weapons.\"\n \n  \"I seem to recall that our first contact of skirmishforms involved the\nuse of a weapon by one of your units.\"\n \n  \"My apologies,\" said Retief. \"The—ah—the skirmishform failed to\nrecognize that he was dealing with a sportsman.\"\n \n  \"Still, now that we have commenced so merrily with weapons....\" Hoshick\nsignaled and the servant refilled tubes.\n \n  \"There is an aspect I haven't yet mentioned,\" Retief went on. \"I hope\nyou won't take this personally, but the fact is, our skirmishforms\nthink of weapons as something one employs only in dealing with certain\nspecific life-forms.\"\n \n  \"Oh? Curious. What forms are those?\"\n \n  \"Vermin. Or 'varmints' as some call them. Deadly antagonists, but\nlacking in caste. I don't want our skirmishforms thinking of such\nworthy adversaries as yourself as varmints.\"\n \n  \"Dear me! I hadn't realized, of course. Most considerate of you to\npoint it out.\" Hoshick clucked in dismay. \"I see that skirmishforms are\nmuch the same among you as with us: lacking in perception.\" He laughed\nscratchily. \"Imagine considering us as—what was the word?—varmints.\"\n \n  \"Which brings us to the crux of the matter. You see, we're up against\na serious problem with regard to skirmishforms. A low birth rate.\nTherefore we've reluctantly taken to substitutes for the mass actions\nso dear to the heart of the sportsman. We've attempted to put an end to\nthese contests altogether....\"\n \n  Hoshick coughed explosively, sending a spray of wine into the air.\n\"What are you saying?\" he gasped. \"Are you proposing that Hoshick of\nthe Mosaic of the Two Dawns abandon honor....?\"\n \n  \"Sir!\" said Retief sternly. \"You forget yourself. I, Retief of the Red\nTape Mountain, make an alternate proposal more in keeping with the\nnewest sporting principles.\"\n \n  \"New?\" cried Hoshick. \"My dear Retief, what a pleasant surprise! I'm\nenthralled with novel modes. One gets so out of touch. Do elaborate.\"\n \n  \"It's quite simple, really. Each side selects a representative and the\ntwo individuals settle the issue between them.\"\n \n  \"I ... um ... fear I don't understand. What possible significance could\none attach to the activities of a couple of random skirmishforms?\"\n \n  \"I haven't made myself clear,\" said Retief. He took a sip of wine. \"We\ndon't involve the skirmishforms at all. That's quite passe.\"\n \n  \"You don't mean...?\"\n \n  \"That's right. You and me.\"\nOutside on the starlit sand Retief tossed aside the power pistol,\nfollowed it with the leather shirt Swazey had lent him. By the faint\nlight he could just make out the towering figure of the Flap-jack\nrearing up before him, his trappings gone. A silent rank of Flap-jack\nretainers were grouped behind him.\n \n  \"I fear I must lay aside the translator now, Retief,\" said Hoshick.\nHe sighed and rippled his fringe tentacles. \"My spawn-fellows will\nnever credit this. Such a curious turn fashion has taken. How much\nmore pleasant it is to observe the action of the skirmishforms from a\ndistance.\"\n \n  \"I suggest we use Tennessee rules,\" said Retief. \"They're very liberal.\nBiting, gouging, stomping, kneeing and of course choking, as well as\nthe usual punching, shoving and kicking.\"\n \n  \"Hmmm. These gambits seem geared to forms employing rigid\nendo-skeletons; I fear I shall be at a disadvantage.\"\n \n  \"Of course,\" Retief said, \"if you'd prefer a more plebeian type of\ncontest....\"\n \n  \"By no means. But perhaps we could rule out tentacle-twisting, just to\neven it.\"\n \n  \"Very well. Shall we begin?\"\n \n  With a rush Hoshick threw himself at Retief, who ducked, whirled, and\nleaped on the Flap-jack's back ... and felt himself flipped clear by\na mighty ripple of the alien's slab-like body. Retief rolled aside\nas Hoshick turned on him; he jumped to his feet and threw a right\nhay-maker to Hoshick's mid-section. The alien whipped his left fringe\naround in an arc that connected with Retief's jaw, sent him spinning\nonto his back ... and Hoshick's weight struck him.\nRetief twisted, tried to roll. The flat body of the alien blanketed\nhim. He worked an arm free, drumming blows on the leathery back.\nHoshick nestled closer.\n \n  Retief's air was running out. He heaved up against the smothering\nweight. Nothing budged.\n \n  It was like burial under a dump-truck-load of concrete.\n \n  He remembered the rangerform he had captured. The sensitive orifice\nhad been placed ventrally, in what would be the thoracic area....\n \n  He groped, felt tough hide set with horny granules. He would be missing\nskin tomorrow ... if there was a tomorrow. His thumb found the orifice\nand probed.\n \n  The Flap-jack recoiled. Retief held fast, probed deeper, groping with\nthe other hand. If the alien were bilaterally symmetrical there would\nbe a set of ready made hand-holds....\nThere were.\n \n  Retief dug in and the Flap-jack writhed, pulled away. Retief held on,\nscrambled to his feet, threw his weight against the alien and fell on\ntop of him, still gouging. Hoshick rippled his fringe wildly, flopped\nin terror, then went limp.\n \n  Retief relaxed, released his hold and got to his feet, breathing hard.\nHoshick humped himself over onto his ventral side, lifted and moved\ngingerly over to the sidelines. His retainers came forward, assisted\nhim into his trappings, strapped on the translator. He sighed heavily,\nadjusted the volume.\n \n  \"There is much to be said for the old system,\" he said. \"What a burden\none's sportsmanship places on one at times.\"\n \n  \"Great sport, wasn't it?\" said Retief. \"Now, I know you'll be eager to\ncontinue. If you'll just wait while I run back and fetch some of our\ngougerforms—\"\n \n  \"May hide-ticks devour the gougerforms!\" Hoshick bellowed. \"You've\ngiven me such a sprong-ache as I'll remember each spawning-time for a\nyear.\"\n \n  \"Speaking of hide-ticks,\" said Retief, \"we've developed a biterform—\"\n \n  \"Enough!\" Hoshick roared, so loudly that the translator bounced on his\nhide. \"Suddenly I yearn for the crowded yellow sands of Jaq. I had\nhoped....\" He broke off, drew a rasping breath. \"I had hoped, Retief,\"\nhe said, speaking sadly now, \"to find a new land here where I might\nplan my own Mosaic, till these alien sands and bring forth such a crop\nof paradise-lichen as should glut the markets of a hundred worlds. But\nmy spirit is not equal to the prospect of biterforms and gougerforms\nwithout end. I am shamed before you....\"\n \n  \"To tell you the truth, I'm old-fashioned myself. I'd rather watch the\naction from a distance too.\"\n \n  \"But surely your spawn-fellows would never condone such an attitude.\"\n \n  \"My spawn-fellows aren't here. And besides, didn't I mention it? No\none who's really in the know would think of engaging in competition by\nmere combat if there were any other way. Now, you mentioned tilling the\nsand, raising lichens—things like that—\"\n \n  \"That on which we dined but now,\" said Hoshick, \"and from which the\nwine is made.\"\n \n  \"The big news in fashionable diplomacy today is farming competition.\nNow, if you'd like to take these deserts and raise lichen, we'll\npromise to stick to the oases and vegetables.\"\n \n  Hoshick curled his back in attention. \"Retief, you're quite serious?\nYou would leave all the fair sand hills to us?\"\n \n  \"The whole works, Hoshick. I'll take the oases.\"\n \n  Hoshick rippled his fringes ecstatically. \"Once again you have outdone\nme, Retief,\" he cried. \"This time, in generosity.\"\n \n  \"We'll talk over the details later. I'm sure we can establish a set of\nrules that will satisfy all parties. Now I've got to get back. I think\nsome of the gougerforms are waiting to see me.\"\nIV\n \n  It was nearly dawn when Retief gave the whistled signal he had agreed\non with Potter, then rose and walked into the camp circle. Swazey stood\nup.\n \n  \"There you are,\" he said. \"We been wonderin' whether to go out after\nyou.\"\n \n  Lemuel came forward, one eye black to the cheekbone. He held out a\nraw-boned hand. \"Sorry I jumped you, stranger. Tell you the truth, I\nthought you was some kind of stool-pigeon from the CDT.\"\n \n  Bert came up behind Lemuel. \"How do you know he ain't, Lemuel?\" he\nsaid. \"Maybe he—\"\n \n  Lemuel floored Bert with a backward sweep of his arm. \"Next\ncotton-picker says some embassy Johnny can cool me gets worse'n that.\"\n \n  \"Tell me,\" said Retief. \"How are you boys fixed for wine?\"\n \n  \"Wine? Mister, we been livin' on stump water for a year now. 'Dobe's\nfatal to the kind of bacteria it takes to ferment likker.\"\n \n  \"Try this.\" Retief handed over a sqat jug. Swazey drew the cork,\nsniffed, drank and passed it to Lemuel.\n \n  \"Mister, where'd you get that?\"\n \n  \"The Flap-jacks make it. Here's another question for you: Would you\nconcede a share in this planet to the Flap-jacks in return for a peace\nguarantee?\"\n \n  At the end of a half hour of heated debate Lemuel turned to Retief.\n\"We'll make any reasonable deal,\" he said. \"I guess they got as much\nright here as we have. I think we'd agree to a fifty-fifty split.\nThat'd give about a hundred and fifty oases to each side.\"\n \n  \"What would you say to keeping all the oases and giving them the\ndesert?\"\n \n  Lemuel reached for the wine jug, eyes on Retief. \"Keep talkin',\nmister,\" he said. \"I think you got yourself a deal.\"\nConsul Passwyn glanced up at Retief, went on perusing a paper.\n \n  \"Sit down, Retief,\" he said absently. \"I thought you were over on\nPueblo, or Mud-flat, or whatever they call that desert.\"\n \n  \"I'm back.\"\n \n  Passwyn eyed him sharply. \"Well, well, what is it you need, man? Speak\nup. Don't expect me to request any military assistance, no matter how\nthings are....\"\n \n  Retief passed a bundle of documents across the desk. \"Here's the\nTreaty. And a Mutual Assistance Pact declaration and a trade agreement.\"\n \n  \"Eh?\" Passwyn picked up the papers, riffled through them. He leaned\nback in his chair, beamed.\n \n  \"Well, Retief. Expeditiously handled.\" He stopped, blinked at Retief.\n\"You seem to have a bruise on your jaw. I hope you've been conducting\nyourself as befits a member of the Embassy staff.\"\n \n  \"I attended a sporting event,\" Retief said. \"One of the players got a\nlittle excited.\"\n \n  \"Well ... it's one of the hazards of the profession. One must\npretend an interest in such matters.\" Passwyn rose, extended a hand.\n\"You've done well, my boy. Let this teach you the value of following\ninstructions to the letter.\"\n \n  Outside, by the hall incinerator drop, Retief paused long enough to\ntake from his briefcase a large buff envelope, still sealed, and drop\nit in the slot.\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Retief of the Red-Tape Mountain, by Keith Laumer", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "61146", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

But to face the horrors of such a planet as this was too much. Imagine Fawkes' terrible predicament; plenty of food—and twenty seven beautiful girls for companions.\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Spring 1945. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n\n \n Jonathan Fawkes opened his eyes. He was flat on his back, and a girl was bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the girl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The sky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his bunk aboard the space ship.\n \n \"You're not dead?\"\n \n \"I've some doubt about that,\" he replied dryly. He levered himself to his elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was pert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.\n \n \"Is—is anything broken?\" she asked.\n \n \"Don't know. Help me up.\" Between them he managed to struggle to his feet. He winced. He said, \"My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot with Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a concrete mixer.\"\n \n She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away. Its nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It had burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had survived at all. He scratched his head. \"I was running from Mars to Jupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.\"\n \n \"Oh!\" said the girl, biting her lips. \"Your co-pilot must be in the wreckage.\"\n \n He shook his head. \"No,\" he reassured her. \"I left him on Mars. He had an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was the trouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her on her course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawling into my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me.\" He paused. \"I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would have been a cinder by this time,\" he said.\n \n The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmatic smile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wished that pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, \"Where am I? I couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.\"\n \n The girl shrugged her shoulders.\n \n \"I don't know.\"\n \n \"You don't know!\" He almost forgot his self-consciousness in his surprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile across the plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upward higher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chain of mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated cone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just he and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast rolling prairie.\n \n \"I was going to explain,\" he heard her say. \"We think that we are on an asteroid.\"\n \n \"We?\" he looked back at her.\n \n \"Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too, only we were going to be wives for the colonists.\"\n \n \"I remember,\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't the Jupiter Food-growers Association enlist you girls to go to the colonies?\"\n \n She nodded her head. \"Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.\"\n \n \"Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor,\" he said.\n \n \"We hit this asteroid.\"\n \n \"But that was three years ago.\"\n \n \"Has it been that long? We lost track of time.\" She didn't take her eyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely self conscious. She said, \"I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I saw your space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in a heap. I thought you were dead.\" She stooped, picked up a spear.\n \n \"Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only about four miles,\" she said.\n \n \"I think so,\" he said.\n \n \n\n \n Jonathan Fawkes fidgeted uncomfortably. He would rather pilot a space ship through a meteor field than face twenty-seven young women. They were the only thing in the Spaceways of which he was in awe. Then he realized that the girl's dark blue eyes had strayed beyond him. A frown of concentration marred her regular features. He turned around.\n \n On the rim of the prairie he saw a dozen black specks moving toward them.\n \n She said: \"Get down!\" Her voice was agitated. She flung herself on her stomach and began to crawl away from the wreck. Jonathan Fawkes stared after her stupidly. \"Get down!\" she reiterated in a furious voice.\n \n He let himself to his hands and knees. \"Ouch!\" he said. He felt like he was being jabbed with pins. He must be one big bruise. He scuttled after the girl. \"What's wrong?\"\n \n The girl looked back at him over her shoulder. \"Centaurs!\" she said. \"I didn't know they had returned. There is a small ravine just ahead which leads into the hills. I don't think they've seen us. If we can reach the hills we'll be safe.\"\n \n \"Centaurs! Isn't there anything new under the sun?\"\n \n \"Well, personally,\" she replied, \"I never saw a Centaur until I was wrecked on this asteroid.\" She reached the ravine, crawled head foremost over the edge. Jonathan tumbled after her. He hit the bottom, winced, scrambled to his feet. The girl started at a trot for the hills. Jonathan, groaning at each step, hobbled beside her.\n \n \"Why won't the Centaurs follow us into the hills?\" he panted.\n \n \"Too rough. They're like horses,\" she said. \"Nothing but a goat could get around in the hills.\"\n \n The gulley, he saw, was deepening into a respectable canyon, then a gorge. In half a mile, the walls towered above them. A narrow ribbon of sky was visible overhead. Yellow fern-like plants sprouted from the crevices and floor of the canyon.\n \n They flushed a small furry creature from behind a bush. As it sped away, it resembled a cottontail of Earth. The girl whipped back her arm, flung the spear. It transfixed the rodent. She picked it up, tied it to her waist. Jonathan gaped. Such strength and accuracy astounded him. He thought, amazons and centaurs. He thought, but this is the year\n3372; not the time of ancient Greece.\n \n The canyon bore to the left. It grew rougher, the walls more precipitate. Jonathan limped to a halt. High boots and breeches, the uniform of Universal's space pilots, hadn't been designed for walking.\n\"Hold on,\" he said. He felt in his pockets, withdrew an empty cigarette package, crumpled it and hurled it to the ground.\n \n \"You got a cigarette?\" he asked without much hope.\n \n The girl shook her head. \"We ran out of tobacco the first few months we were here.\"\n \n Jonathan turned around, started back for the space ship.\n \n \"Where are you going?\" cried Ann in alarm.\n \n He said, \"I've got a couple of cartons of cigarettes back at the freighter. Centaurs or no centaurs, I'm going to get a smoke.\"\n \n \"No!\" She clutched his arm. He was surprised at the strength of her grip. \"They'd kill you,\" she said.\n \n \"I can sneak back,\" he insisted stubbornly. \"They might loot the ship. I don't want to lose those cigarettes. I was hauling some good burley tobacco seed too. The colonists were going to experiment with it on Ganymede.\"\n \n \"No!\"\n \n He lifted his eyebrows. He thought, she is an amazon! He firmly detached her hand.\n \n The girl flicked up her spear, nicked his neck with the point of it.\n\"We are going to the camp,\" she said.\n \n Jonathan threw himself down backwards, kicked the girl's feet out from under her. Like a cat he scrambled up and wrenched the spear away.\n \n A voice shouted: \"What's going on there?\"\n \n \n\n \n He paused shamefacedly. A second girl, he saw, was running toward them from up the canyon. Her bare legs flashed like ivory. She was barefooted, and she had black hair. A green cloth was wrapped around her sarong fashion. She bounced to a stop in front of Jonathan, her brown eyes wide in surprise. He thought her sarong had been a table cloth at one time in its history.\n \n \"A man!\" she breathed. \"By Jupiter and all its little moons, it's a man!\"\n \n \"Don't let him get away!\" cried Ann.\n \n \"Hilda!\" the brunette shrieked. \"A man! It's a man!\"\n \n A third girl skidded around the bend in the canyon. Jonathan backed off warily.\n \n Ann Clotilde cried in anguish: \"Don't let him get away!\"\n \n Jonathan chose the centaurs. He wheeled around, dashed back the way he had come. Someone tackled him. He rolled on the rocky floor of the canyon. He struggled to his feet. He saw six more girls race around the bend in the canyon. With shouts of joy they flung themselves on him.\n \n Jonathan was game, but the nine husky amazons pinned him down by sheer weight. They bound him hand and foot. Then four of them picked him up bodily, started up the canyon chanting: \" He was a rocket riding daddy from Mars. \" He recognized it as a popular song of three years ago.\n \n Jonathan had never been so humiliated in his life. He was known in the spaceways from Mercury to Jupiter as a man to leave alone. His nose had been broken three times. A thin white scar crawled down the bronze of his left cheek, relic of a barroom brawl on Venus. He was big, rangy, tough. And these girls had trounced him. Girls! He almost wept from mortification.\n \n He said, \"Put me down. I'll walk.\"\n \n \"You won't try to get away?\" said Ann.\n \n \"No,\" he replied with as much dignity as he could summon while being held aloft by four barbarous young women.\n \n \"Let him down,\" said Ann. \"We can catch him, anyway, if he makes a break.\"\n \n Jonathan Fawkes' humiliation was complete. He meekly trudged between two husky females, who ogled him shamelessly. He was amazed at the ease with which they had carried him. He was six feet three and no light weight. He thought enviously of the centaurs, free to gallop across the plains. He wished he was a centaur.\n \n The trail left the canyon, struggled up the precipitate walls. Jonathan picked his way gingerly, hugged the rock. \"Don't be afraid,\" advised one of his captors. \"Just don't look down.\"\n \n \"I'm not afraid,\" said Jonathan hotly. To prove it he trod the narrow ledge with scorn. His foot struck a pebble. Both feet went out from under him. He slithered halfway over the edge. For one sickening moment he thought he was gone, then Ann grabbed him by the scruff of his neck, hauled him back to safety. He lay gasping on his stomach. They tied a rope around his waist then, and led him the rest of the way to the top like a baby on a leash. He was too crestfallen to resent it.\n \n The trail came out on a high ridge. They paused on a bluff overlooking the prairie.\n \n \"Look!\" cried Ann pointing over the edge.\n \n A half dozen beasts were trotting beneath on the plain. At first, Jonathan mistook them for horses. Then he saw that from the withers up they resembled men. Waists, shoulders, arms and heads were identical to his own, but their bodies were the bodies of horses.\n \n \"Centaurs!\" Jonathan Fawkes said, not believing his eyes.\n \n \n\n \n The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, who reared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which they hurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintly like the neighing of horses.\n \n Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problem of the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurred to him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth's moon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due to the lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirty times as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke.\n \n At length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insults back and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girls resumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes. The brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots.\n \n \"I'm Olga,\" she confided. \"Has anybody ever told you what a handsome fellow you are?\" She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed.\n \n They climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deep valley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were trees along its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head of the valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.\n \n They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behind a promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the coming ordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knew the girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camp like a bag of meal.\n \n The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space liner reappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skidded and rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It reminded him of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. He looked away hastily.\n \n Someone hailed them from the space ship.\n \n \"We've caught a man,\" shrieked one of his captors.\n \n A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.\n \n \"A man!\" screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. She had green eyes. \"We're rescued!\"\n \n \"No. No,\" Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. \"He was wrecked like us.\"\n \n \"Oh,\" came a disappointed chorus.\n \n \"He's a man,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"That's the next best thing.\"\n \n \"Oh, Olga,\" said a strapping brunette. \"Who'd ever thought a man could look so good?\"\n \n \"I did,\" said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shivered like an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He felt like a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats.\n \n A big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said,\n\"Dinner's ready.\" Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him of the voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at him appraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. \"Bring him into the ship,\" she said. \"The man must be starved.\"\n \n He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of the wrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center of the floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. His feet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into the Thirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.\n \n With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprang forward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to be seated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt like a captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiar settings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, Jonathan Fawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wild women.\n \n \n\n \n As the meal boisterously progressed, he regained sufficient courage to glance timidly around. Directly across the table sat a striking, grey-eyed girl whose brown hair was coiled severely about her head. She looked to him like a stenographer. He watched horrified as she seized a whole roast fowl, tore it apart with her fingers, gnawed a leg. She caught him staring at her and rolled her eyes at him. He returned his gaze to his plate.\n \n Olga said: \"Hey, Sultan.\"\n \n He shuddered, but looked up questioningly.\n \n She said, \"How's the fish?\"\n \n \"Good,\" he mumbled between a mouthful. \"Where did you get it?\"\n \n \"Caught it,\" said Olga. \"The stream's full of 'em. I'll take you fishing tomorrow.\" She winked at him so brazenly that he choked on a bone.\n \n \"Heaven forbid,\" he said.\n \n \"How about coming with me to gather fruit?\" cried the green-eyed blonde; \"you great big handsome man.\"\n \n \"Or me?\" cried another. And the table was in an uproar.\n \n The rawboned woman who had summoned them to dinner, pounded the table until the cups and plates danced. Jonathan had gathered that she was called Billy.\n \n \"Quiet!\" She shrieked in her loud strident voice. \"Let him be. He can't go anywhere for a few days. He's just been through a wreck. He needs rest.\" She turned to Jonathan who had shrunk down in his chair. \"How about some roast?\" she said.\n \n \"No.\" He pushed back his plate with a sigh. \"If I only had a smoke.\"\n \n Olga gave her unruly black hair a flirt. \"Isn't that just like a man?\"\n \n \"I wouldn't know,\" said the green-eyed blonde. \"I've forgotten what they're like.\"\n \n Billy said, \"How badly wrecked is your ship?\"\n \n \"It's strewn all over the landscape,\" he replied sleepily.\n \n \"Is there any chance of patching it up?\"\n \n He considered the question. More than anything else, he decided, he wanted to sleep. \"What?\" he said.\n \n \"Is there any possibility of repairing your ship?\" repeated Billy.\n \n \"Not outside the space docks.\"\n \n They expelled their breath, but not for an instant did they relax the barrage of their eyes. He shifted position in embarrassment. The movement pulled his muscles like a rack. Furthermore, an overpowering lassitude was threatening to pop him off to sleep before their eyes.\n \n \"You look exhausted,\" said Ann.\n \n Jonathan dragged himself back from the edge of sleep. \"Just tired,\" he mumbled. \"Haven't had a good night's rest since I left Mars.\" Indeed it was only by the most painful effort that he kept awake at all. His eyelids drooped lower and lower.\n \n \"First it's tobacco,\" said Olga; \"now he wants to sleep. Twenty-seven girls and he wants to sleep.\"\n \n \"He is asleep,\" said the green-eyed blonde.\n \n \n\n \n Jonathan was slumped forward across the table, his head buried in his arms.\n \n \"Catch a hold,\" said Billy, pushing back from the table. A dozen girls volunteered with a rush. \"Hoist!\" said Billy. They lifted him like a sleepy child, bore him tenderly up an incline and into a stateroom, where they deposited him on the bed.\n \n Ann said to Olga; \"Help me with these boots.\" But they resisted every tug. \"It's no use,\" groaned Ann, straightening up and wiping her bright yellow hair back from her eyes. \"His feet have swollen. We'll have to cut them off.\"\n \n At these words, Jonathan raised upright as if someone had pulled a rope.\n \n \" Cut off whose feet? \" he cried in alarm.\n \n \"Not your feet, silly,\" said Ann. \"Your boots.\"\n \n \"Lay a hand on those boots,\" he scowled; \"and I'll make me another pair out of your hides. They set me back a week's salary.\" Having delivered himself of this ultimatum, he went back to sleep.\n \n Olga clapped her hand to her forehead. \"And this,\" she cried \"is what we've been praying for during the last three years.\"\n \n The next day found Jonathan Fawkes hobbling around by the aid of a cane. At the portal of the space ship, he stuck out his head, glanced all around warily. None of the girls were in sight. They had, he presumed, gone about their chores: hunting, fishing, gathering fruits and berries. He emerged all the way and set out for the creek. He walked with an exaggerated limp just in case any of them should be hanging around. As long as he was an invalid he was safe, he hoped.\n \n He sighed. Not every man could be waited on so solicitously by twenty-seven handsome strapping amazons. He wished he could carry it off in cavalier fashion. He hobbled to the creek, sat down beneath the shade of a tree. He just wasn't the type, he supposed. And it might be years before they were rescued.\n \n As a last resort, he supposed, he could hide out in the hills or join the centaurs. He rather fancied himself galloping across the plains on the back of a centaur. He looked up with a start. Ann Clotilde was ambling toward him.\n \n \"How's the invalid?\" she said, seating herself beside him.\n \n \"Hot, isn't it?\" he said. He started to rise. Ann Clotilde placed the flat of her hand on his chest and shoved. \" Ooof! \" he grunted. He sat down rather more forcibly than he had risen.\n \n \"Don't get up because of me,\" she informed him. \"It's my turn to cook, but I saw you out here beneath the trees. Dinner can wait. Jonathan do you know that you are irresistible?\" She seized his shoulders, stared into his eyes. He couldn't have felt any more uncomfortable had a hungry boa constrictor draped itself in his arms. He mopped his brow with his sleeve.\n \n \"Suppose the rest should come,\" he said in an embarrassed voice.\n \n \"They're busy. They won't be here until I call them to lunch. Your eyes,\" she said, \"are like deep mysterious pools.\"\n \n \"Sure enough?\" said Jonathan with involuntary interest. He began to recover his nerve.\n \n She said, \"You're the best looking thing.\" She rumpled his hair. \"I can't keep my eyes off you.\"\n \n Jonathan put his arm around her gingerly. \"Ouch!\" He winced. He had forgotten his sore muscles.\n \n \"I forgot,\" said Ann Clotilde in a contrite voice. She tried to rise.\n\"You're hurt.\"\n \n He pulled her back down. \"Not so you could notice it,\" he grinned.\n \n \"Well!\" came the strident voice of Billy from behind them. \"We're all glad to hear that!\"\n \n \n\n \n Jonathan leaped to his feet, dumping Ann to the ground. He jerked around. All twenty-six of the girls were lined up on the path. Their features were grim. He said: \"I don't feel so well after all.\"\n \n \"It don't wash,\" said Billy. \"It's time for a showdown.\"\n \n Jonathan's hair stood on end. He felt rather than saw Ann Clotilde take her stand beside him. He noticed that she was holding her spear at a menacing angle. She said in an angry voice: \"He's mine. I found him. Leave him alone.\"\n \n \"Where do you get that stuff?\" cried Olga. \"Share and share alike, say I.\"\n \n \"We could draw straws for him,\" suggested the green-eyed blonde.\n \n \"Look here,\" Jonathan broke in. \"I've got some say in the matter.\"\n \n \"You have not,\" snapped Billy. \"You'll do just as we say.\" She took a step toward him.\n \n Jonathan edged away in consternation.\n \n \"He's going to run!\" Olga shouted.\n \n Jonathan never stopped until he was back in the canyon leading to the plain. His nerves were jumping like fleas. He craved the soothing relaxation of a smoke. There was, he remembered, a carton of cigarettes at the wreck. He resumed his flight, but at a more sober pace.\n \n At the spot where he and Ann had first crawled away from the centaurs, he scrambled out of the gulley, glanced in the direction of his space ship. He blinked his eyes, stared. Then he waved his arms, shouted and tore across the prairie. A trim space cruiser was resting beside the wreck of his own. Across its gleaming monaloid hull ran an inscription in silver letters: \"INTERSTELLAR COSMOGRAPHY SOCIETY.\"\n \n Two men crawled out of Jonathan's wrecked freighter, glanced in surprise at Jonathan. A third man ran from the cruiser, a Dixon Ray Rifle in his hand.\n \n \"I'm Jonathan Fawkes,\" said the castaway as he panted up, \"pilot for Universal. I was wrecked.\"\n \n A tall elderly man held out his hand. He had a small black waxed mustache and Van Dyke. He was smoking a venusian cigarette in a yellow composition holder. He said, \"I'm Doctor Boynton.\" He had a rich cultivated voice, and a nose like a hawk. \"We are members of the Interstellar Cosmography Society. We've been commissioned to make a cursory examination of this asteroid. You had a nasty crack up, Mr. Fawkes. But you are in luck, sir. We were on the point of returning when we sighted the wreck.\"\n \n \"I say,\" said the man who had run out of the cruiser. He was a prim, energetic young man. Jonathan noted that he carried the ray gun gingerly, respectfully. \"We're a week overdue now,\" he said. \"If you have any personal belongings that you'd like to take with you, you'd best be getting them aboard.\"\n \n \n\n \n Jonathan's face broke into a grin. He said, \"Do any of you know how to grow tobacco?\"\n \n They glanced at each other in perplexity.\n \n \"I like it here,\" continued Jonathan. \"I'm not going back.\"\n \n \"What?\" cried the three explorers in one breath.\n \n \"I'm going to stay,\" he repeated. \"I only came back here after the cigarettes.\"\n \n \"But it will be three years before the asteroid's orbit brings it back in the space lanes,\" said Doctor Boynton. \"You don't possibly expect to be picked up before then!\"\n \n Jonathan shook his head, began to load himself with tools, tobacco seed, and cigarettes.\n \n \"Odd.\" Doctor Boynton shook his head, turned to the others. \"Though if I remember correctly, there was quite an epidemic of hermits during the medieval period. It was an esthetic movement. They fled to the wilderness to escape the temptation of women .\"\n \n Jonathan laughed outright.\n \n \"You are sure you won't return, young man?\"\n \n He shook his head. They argued, they cajoled, but Jonathan was adamant. He said, \"You might report my accident to Universal. Tell them to stop one of their Jupiter-bound freighters here when the asteroid swings back in the space ways. I'll have a load for them.\"\n \n Inside the ship, Doctor Boynton moved over to a round transparent port hole. \"What a strange fellow,\" he murmured. He was just in time to see the castaway, loaded like a pack mule, disappear in the direction from which he had come.\n \n Robinson Crusoe was going back to his man (?)

HINCKLEY\n \n \n It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister city of metal that glittered malignantly before the cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.\n \n [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1955. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n \n \n \n Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one usually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has occurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence at the city a quarter-mile away.\n \n He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the twilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the barren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they landed, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.\n \n He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.\n \n Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men, unbuckled his safety belt and stood up. \"Shall we, gentlemen?\" and with a graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.\n \n Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the stillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight sky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the city. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build a city—even a city like this one—in such surroundings.\n \n The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting geometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight, and the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while this planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return in their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition had, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return flight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only city on the planet—the planet without any life at all, save tiny mosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from the city a man moved, he would always be going north.\n \n \"Hey, Martin!\" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.\n\"Wind,\" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black pile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. \"That's all we need, isn't it?\"\n \n Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust cavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little, adjusting his radio. \"Worried?\"\n \n Rodney's bony face was without expression. \"Gives me the creeps, kind of. I wonder what they were like?\"\n \n Wass murmured, \"Let us hope they aren't immortal.\"\n \n Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the sand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining metal band.\n \n Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.\n\"It's here, too.\"\n \n Martin stood up. \"Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell them we're going in.\"\n \n Rodney nodded.\n \n After a time, Wass said, \"Here, too. How far do you think it goes?\"\n \n Martin shrugged. \"Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it is—was—for.\"\n \n \"Defense,\" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.\n \n \"Could be,\" Martin said. \"Let's go in.\"\n \n The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street, their broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They passed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved cautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square surrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.\n \n Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. \"Not—not very big. Is it?\"\n \n Wass looked at him shrewdly. \"Neither were the—well, shall we call them, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?\"\n \n Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering—\"Maybe they crawled.\"\n \n A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved slowly across Martin's mind. \"All right!\" he rapped out—and the image faded.\n \n \"Sorry,\" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw. Then—\"I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light at all?\"\n \n \"I imagine they had illumination of some sort,\" Martin answered, dryly.\n\"If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship, we're very likely to find out.\"\n \n Rodney said quickly, \"I mean outside.\"\n \n \"Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination.\" Martin looked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past that out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat lay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow, from here, a little dim, a little hazy.\n \n He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that explained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was something familiar, yet twisted and distorted.\n \n \"Well,\" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, \"now that we're here....\"\n \n \"Pictures,\" Martin decided. \"We have twelve hours. We'll start here. What's the matter, Wass?\"\n \n The blond man grinned ruefully. \"I left the camera in the lifeboat.\" There was a pause. Then Wass, defensively—\"It's almost as if the city didn't want to be photographed.\"\n \n Martin ignored the remark. \"Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere along this street.\"\n \n Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal street, at right angles to their path of entrance.\n \n Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was almost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point being, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and subtle, things no man could ever comprehend.\n \n Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere, sometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the heavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before the thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he decided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.\n \n Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up Martin's spine. \"What's the matter?\"\n \n The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. \"I saw—I thought I saw—something—moving—\"\n \n Anger rose in Martin. \"You didn't,\" he said flatly, gripping the other's shoulder cruelly. \"You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself, man!\"\n \n Rodney stared. \"The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.\"\n \n \"... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing from the other direction.\"\n \n Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. \"That—\"\n \n \"Martin!\" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.\n\"Martin, I can't get out!\"\n \n \n\n \n Rodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up.\n \n Wass said, more quietly, \"Remember that metal band? It's all clear now, and glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a glass wall.\"\n \n \"We're trapped, we're trapped, they are—\"\n \n \"Shut up, Rodney! Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge. I'll check here.\"\n \n Martin clapped a hand on Rodney's shoulder again, starting him moving, toward the city's edge, past the black, silent buildings.\n \n The glittering band was here, too, like a halo around a silhouette.\n \n \"No go,\" Martin said to Wass. He bit at his lower lip. \"I think it must be all around us.\" He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences of this. Then—\"We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we separated.\"\n \n Walking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic through the radio receiver against his ear. \"What do you suppose caused this?\"\n \n He shook his head angrily, saying, \"Judging by reports of the rest of the planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of it.\"\n \n \"Man-made radiation, you mean.\"\n \n Martin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. \"Well, alien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war.\"\n \n Wass' voice sounded startled. \"Anti-radiation screen?\"\n \n Rodney interrupted, \"There hasn't been enough radiation around here for hundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.\"\n \n Wass said coldly, \"He's right, Martin.\"\n \n Martin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. \"You're both wrong,\" he said. \"We landed here today.\"\n \n Rodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at Martin. \"The wind—?\"\n \n \"Why not?\"\n \n \"That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then.\" Rodney stood straighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer.\n \n They reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass, and stood watching him labor along the metal toward them.\n \n Wass' face, Martin saw, was sober. \"I tried to call the ship. No luck.\"\n \n \"The shield?\"\n \n Wass nodded. \"What else?\"\n \n \"I don't know—\"\n \n \"If we went to the roof of the tallest building,\" Rodney offered, \"we might—\"\n \n Martin shook his head. \"No. To be effective, the shield would have to cover the city.\"\n \n Wass stared down at the metal street, as if he could look through it.\n\"I wonder where it gets its power?\"\n \n \"Down below, probably. If there is a down below.\" Martin hesitated. \"We may have to....\"\n \n \"What?\" Rodney prompted.\n \n Martin shrugged. \"Let's look.\"\n \n He led the way through a shoulder-high arch in one of the tall buildings surrounding the square. The corridor inside was dim and plain, and he switched on his flashlight, the other two immediately following his example. The walls and the rounded ceiling of the corridor were of the same dull metal as the buildings' facades, and the streets. There were a multitude of doors and arches set into either side of the corridor.\n \n It was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive.\n \n Martin chose an arch, with beyond it a metal ramp, which tilted downward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch.\n \n A call from Rodney halted him. \"Back here,\" the tall man repeated. \"It looks like a switchboard.\"\n \n The three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a great arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had come to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining through the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick rope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal roof.\n \n \"Is this it,\" Wass murmured, \"or an auxiliary?\"\n \n Martin shrugged. \"The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently.\"\n \n \"Another assumption,\" Wass said. \"We have done nothing but make assumptions ever since we got here.\"\n \n \"What would you suggest, instead?\" Martin asked calmly.\n \n Rodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch.\n \n \"No!\" Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make.\n \n Rodney turned. \"But—\"\n \n \"No. Wass, how much time have we?\"\n \n \"The ship leaves in eleven hours.\"\n \n \"Eleven hours,\" Rodney repeated. \"Eleven hours!\" He reached out for the switch again. Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly.\n \n He directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. \"What do you think you're doing?\"\n \n \"We have to find out what all this stuff's for!\"\n \n \"Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves.\"\n \n \"We've got to—\"\n \n \"No!\" Then, more quietly—\"We still have eleven hours to find a way out.\"\n \n \"Ten hours and forty-five minutes,\" Wass disagreed softly. \"Minus the time it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow it, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet. And Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin.\"\n \n \"You too, Wass?\"\n \n \"Up to the point of accuracy, yes.\"\n \n Martin said, \"Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always thinking of your own tender hide, of course.\"\n \n Rodney cursed. \"And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us that much less time to find a way out. Martin—\"\n \n \"Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you stand!\"\n \n \n\n \n Wass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. \"We all have guns, Martin.\"\n \n \"I'm holding mine.\" Martin waited.\n \n After a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly,\n\"He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here.\"\n \n \"Well....\" Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. \"Let's get out of here, then!\"\n \n Martin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down the metal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called a halt. \"If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must be at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city.\"\n \n Rodney said, \"To search every building next to the dome clean around the city would take years.\"\n \n Martin nodded. \"But there must be central roads beneath this main level leading to them. Up here there are too many roads.\"\n \n Wass laughed rudely.\n \n \"Have you a better idea?\"\n \n Wass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, \"That leads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible for the dome, does it project down into the ground as well?\"\n \n \"You mean dig out?\" Martin asked.\n \n \"Sure. Why not?\"\n \n \"We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have no equipment.\"\n \n \"That shouldn't be hard to come by.\"\n \n Martin smiled, banishing Wass' idea.\n \n Rodney said, \"They may have had their digging equipment built right in to themselves.\"\n \n \"Anyway,\" Martin decided, \"we can take a look down below.\"\n \n \"In the pitch dark,\" Wass added.\n \n Martin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp. The incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feet perhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort, gleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of the darkness before the men.\n \n At length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city.\n \n Martin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example. Metal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone down on them.\n \n Wass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly in a circle. \"No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that up there?\"\n \n \"I don't know. I have no idea.\" Martin gestured toward the ramp with his light. \"Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar to you?\"\n \n Rodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers. \"Here?\"\n \n \"No, no,\" Martin answered impatiently, \"not just here. I mean the whole city.\"\n \n \"Yes,\" Wass said dryly, \"it does. I'm sure this is where all my nightmares stay when they're not on shift.\"\n \n Martin turned on his heel and started down a metal avenue which, he thought, paralleled the street above. And Rodney and Wass followed him silently. They moved along the metal, past unfamiliar shapes made more so by gloom and moving shadows, past doors dancing grotesquely in the three lights, past openings in the occasional high metal partitions, past something which was perhaps a conveyor belt, past another something which could have been anything at all.\n \n The metal street ended eventually in a blank metal wall.\n \n The edge of the city—the city which was a dome of force above and a bowl of metal below.\n \n After a long time, Wass sighed. \"Well, skipper...?\"\n \n \"We go back, I guess,\" Martin said.\n \n Rodney turned swiftly to face him. Martin thought the tall man was holding his gun. \"To the switchboard, Martin?\"\n \n \"Unless someone has a better idea,\" Martin conceded. He waited. But Rodney was holding the gun ... and Wass was.... Then—\"I can't think of anything else.\"\n \n They began to retrace their steps along the metal street, back past the same dancing shapes of metal, the partitions, the odd windows, all looking different now in the new angles of illumination.\n \n Martin was in the lead. Wass followed him silently. Rodney, tall, matchstick thin, even in his cumbersome suit, swayed with jaunty triumph in the rear.\n \n Martin looked at the metal street lined with its metal objects and he sighed. He remembered how the dark buildings of the city looked at surface level, how the city itself looked when they were landing, and then when they were walking toward it. The dream was gone again for now. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn. But—The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'd ever explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, and Martin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who at some point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by a sort of racial insanity.\n \n No, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be. Viewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity, a faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alien metal, which was making him theorize so wildly.\n \n Then Wass touched his elbow. \"Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp.\"\n \n Light from their torches was reflected, as from glass.\n \n \"All right,\" Rodney said belligerently into his radio. \"What's holding up the procession?\"\n \n Martin was silent.\n \n Wass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. It was in Wass' own interest. In a moment, all three were standing before a bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far as the combined light of their torches would reach.\n \n \"Seeds!\" Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass.\n \n Martin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips.\n \n Wass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section of the bank.\n \n Martin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city. If they wouldn't grow there.... Or had they, once? \"Don't, Wass!\"\n \n Torchlight reflected from Wass' faceplate as he turned his head. \"Why not?\"\n \n They were like children.... \"We don't know, released, what they'll do.\"\n \n \"Skipper,\" Wass said carefully, \"if we don't get out of this place by the deadline we may be eating these.\"\n \n Martin raised his arm tensely. \"Opening a seed bank doesn't help us find a way out of here.\" He started up the ramp. \"Besides, we've no water.\"\n \n Rodney came last up the ramp, less jaunty now, but still holding the gun. His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. \"For a plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water. Maybe—\" he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing with super-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits \"—only the little moisture in the atmosphere.\"\n \n \n\n \n They stood before the switchboard again. Martin and Wass side by side, Rodney, still holding his gun, slightly to the rear.\n \n Rodney moved forward a little toward the switches. His breathing was loud and rather uneven in the radio receivers.\n \n Martin made a final effort. \"Rodney, it's still almost nine hours to take off. Let's search awhile first. Let this be a last resort.\"\n \n Rodney jerked his head negatively. \"No. Now, I know you, Martin. Postpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves without us and we're stranded here to eat seeds and gradually dehydrate ourselves and God only knows what else and—\"\n \n He reached out convulsively and yanked a switch.\n \n Martin leaped, knocking him to the floor. Rodney's gun skittered away silently, like a live thing, out of the range of the torches.\n \n The radio receivers impersonally recorded the grating sounds of Rodney's sobs.\n \n \"Sorry,\" Martin said, without feeling. He turned quickly. \"Wass?\"\n \n The slight, blond man stood unmoving. \"I'm with you, Martin, but, as a last resort it might be better to be blown sky high than to die gradually—\"\n \n Martin was watching Rodney, struggling to get up. \"I agree. As a last resort. We still have a little time.\"\n \n Rodney's tall, spare figure looked bowed and tired in the torchlight, now that he was up again. \"Martin, I—\"\n \n Martin turned his back. \"Skip it, Rodney,\" he said gently.\n \n \"Water,\" Wass said thoughtfully. \"There must be reservoirs under this city somewhere.\"\n \n Rodney said, \"How does water help us get out?\"\n \n Martin glanced at Wass, then started out of the switchboard room, not looking back. \"It got in and out of the city some way. Perhaps we can leave the same way.\"\n \n Down the ramp again.\n \n \"There's another ramp,\" Wass murmured.\n \n Rodney looked down it. \"I wonder how many there are, all told.\"\n \n Martin placed one foot on the metal incline. He angled his torch down, picking out shadowy, geometrical shapes, duplicates of the ones on the present level. \"We'll find out,\" he said, \"how many there are.\"\n \n Eleven levels later Rodney asked, \"How much time have we now?\"\n \n \"Seven hours,\" Wass said quietly, \"until take-off.\"\n \n \"One more level,\" Martin said, ignoring the reference to time. \"I ... think it's the last.\"\n \n They walked down the ramp and stood together, silent in a dim pool of artificial light on the bottom level of the alien city.\n \n Rodney played his torch about the metal figures carefully placed about the floor. \"Martin, what if there are no reservoirs? What if there are cemeteries instead? Or cold storage units? Maybe the switch I pulled—\"\n \n \"Rodney! Stop it!\"\n \n Rodney swallowed audibly. \"This place scares me....\"\n \n \"The first time I was ever in a rocket, it scared me. I was thirteen.\"\n \n \"This is different,\" Wass said. \"Built-in traps—\"\n \n \"They had a war,\" Martin said.\n \n Wass agreed. \"And the survivors retired here. Why?\"\n \n Martin said, \"They wanted to rebuild. Or maybe this was already built before the war as a retreat.\" He turned impatiently. \"How should I know?\"\n \n Wass turned, too, persistent. \"But the planet was through with them.\"\n \n \"In a minute,\" Martin said, too irritably, \"we'll have a sentient planet.\" From the corner of his eye he saw Rodney start at that. \"Knock it off, Wass. We're looking for reservoirs, you know.\"\n \n They moved slowly down the metal avenue, between the twisted shadow shapes, looking carefully about them.\n \n Rodney paused. \"We might not recognize one.\"\n \n Martin urged him on. \"You know what a man-hole cover looks like.\" He added dryly, \"Use your imagination.\"\n \n They reached the metal wall at the end of the avenue and paused again, uncertain.\n \n Martin swung his flashlight, illuminating the distorted metal shapes.\n \n Wass said, \"All this had a purpose, once....\"\n \n \"We'll disperse and search carefully,\" Martin said.\n \n \"I wonder what the pattern was.\"\n \n \"... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for later expeditions to study. So will we if we don't find a way to get out.\"\n \n Their radios recorded Rodney's gasp. Then—\"Martin! Martin! I think I've found something!\"\n \n Martin began to run. After a moment's hesitation, Wass swung in behind him.\n \n \"Here,\" Rodney said, as they came up to him, out of breath. \"Here. See? Right here.\"\n \n Three flashlights centered on a dark, metal disk raised a foot or more from the floor.\n \n \"Well, they had hands.\" With his torch Wass indicated a small wheel of the same metal as everything else in the city, set beside the disk.\n \n From its design Martin assumed that the disk was meant to be grasped and turned. He wondered what precisely they were standing over.\n \n \"Well, Skipper, are you going to do the honors?\"\n \n Martin kneeled, grasped the wheel. It turned easily—almost too easily—rotating the disk as it turned.\n \n Suddenly, without a sound, the disk rose, like a hatch, on a concealed hinge.\n \n The three men, clad in their suits and helmets, grouped around the six-foot opening, shining their torches down into the thing that drifted and eddied directly beneath them.\n \n Rodney's sudden grip on Martin's wrist nearly shattered the bone.\n\"Martin! It's all alive! It's moving!\"\n \n Martin hesitated long enough for a coil to move sinuously up toward the opening. Then he spun the wheel and the hatch slammed down.\n \n He was shaking.\n \n \n\n \n After a time he said, \"Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Remember the wind? Air currents are moving it.\"\n \n Rodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing. Then—\"It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?\"\n \n Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him, otherwise. He said merely, \"At first I wasn't sure myself.\"\n \n Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gun loosely, and his hand shook. \"Then prove it. Open it again.\"\n \n Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodney and he, too, had drawn his gun.\n \n The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it, outlined in the light of two torches.\n \n For a little while he was alone.\n \n Then—causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney—a tenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about Martin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight, obscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strange objects.\n \n \n\n \n Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmering spirals.\n \n Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He said nothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, and now, himself.\n \n \"How deep,\" Wass said, from his safe distance.\n \n \"We'll have to lower a flashlight,\" Martin answered.\n \n Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with a torch swinging wildly on the end of it.\n \n The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gently rolling mounds of fine, white stuff.\n \n Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lip of the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. \"You'd rather monkey with the switches and blow yourself to smithereens?\"\n \n Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at him disgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering into the infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottom of the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. He stamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standing jump. He sank no farther than his knees.\n \n He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearest edge of the city. \"I think we'll be all right,\" he called out, \"as long as we avoid the drifts.\"\n \n Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.\n \n \"All right, Wass,\" Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope and sank into the dust.\n \n \"Not me,\" the answer came back quickly. \"You two fools go your way, I'll go mine.\"\n \n \"Wass!\"\n \n There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.\n \n The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddied and swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits were hard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.\n \n \"Are we going straight?\" Rodney asked.\n \n \"Of course,\" Martin growled.\n \n There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination. The two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriously plunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, times without number.\n \n Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. \"The ship leaves in two hours, Martin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?\"\n \n Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in his throat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust, his flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed.\n \n A grate.\n \n Rodney stared. \"Wass!\" he shouted. \"We've found a way out!\"\n \n Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. \"I'm at the switchboard now, Martin. I—\"\n \n There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.\n \n The grate groaned upward and stopped.\n \n Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then he began to scream.\n \n Martin switched off his radio, sick.\n \n He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.\n\"Well?\"\n \n \"I've been trying to get you,\" Rodney said, frantically. \"Why didn't you answer?\"\n \n \"We couldn't do anything for him.\"\n \n Rodney's face was white and drawn. \"But he did this for us.\"\n \n \"So he did,\" Martin said, very quietly.\n \n Rodney said nothing.\n \n Then Martin said, \"Did you listen until the end?\"\n \n Rodney nodded, jerkily. \"He pulled three more switches. I couldn't understand it all. But—Martin, dying alone like that in a place like this—!\"\n \n Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted up toward the surface. \"Come on, Rodney. Last lap.\"\n \n An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from the edge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of force shimmering, almost invisible, about it.\n \n Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship. Martin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew members standing by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to run toward them.\n \n \"Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe,\" someone said. It was the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed.", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "63473", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.

Snithian was a bald eagle of a man, dark-eyed, pot-bellied, with the large, expressive hands of a rug merchant. Round-shouldered in a loose cloak, he blinked small reddish eyes at Dan Slane's travel-stained six foot one.\n \n \"Kelly here tells me you've been demanding to see me.\" He nodded toward the florid man at his side. He had a high, thin voice, like something that needed oiling. \"Something about important information regarding safeguarding my paintings.\"\n \n \"That's right, Mr. Snithian,\" Dan said. \"I believe I can be of great help to you.\"\n \n \"Help how? If you've got ideas of bilking me....\" The red eyes bored into Dan like hot pokers.\n \n \"Nothing like that, sir. Now, I know you have quite a system of guards here—the papers are full of it—\"\n \n \"Damned busybodies! Sensation-mongers! If it wasn't for the press, I'd have no concern for my paintings today!\"\n \n \"Yes sir. But my point is, the one really important spot has been left unguarded.\"\n \n \"Now, wait a minute—\" Kelly started.\n \n \"What's that?\" Snithian cut in.\n \n \"You have a hundred and fifty men guarding the house and grounds day and night—\"\n \n \"Two hundred and twenty-five,\" Kelly snapped.\n \n \"—but no one at all in the vault with the paintings,\" Slane finished.\n \n \"Of course not,\" Snithian shrilled. \"Why should I post a man in the vault? It's under constant surveillance from the corridor outside.\"\n \n \"The Harriman paintings were removed from a locked vault,\" Dan said.\n\"There was a special seal on the door. It wasn't broken.\"\n \n \"By the saints, he's right,\" Kelly exclaimed. \"Maybe we ought to have a man in that vault.\"\n \n \"Another idiotic scheme to waste my money,\" Snithian snapped. \"I've made you responsible for security here, Kelly! Let's have no more nonsense. And throw this nincompoop out!\" Snithian turned and stalked away, his cloak flapping at his knees.\n \n \"I'll work cheap,\" Dan called after him as Kelly took his arm. \"I'm an art lover.\"\n \n \"Never mind that,\" Kelly said, escorting Dan along the corridor. He turned in at an office and closed the door.\n \n \"Now, as the old buzzard said, I'm responsible for security here. If those pictures go, my job goes with them. Your vault idea's not bad. Just how cheap would you work?\"\n \n \"A hundred dollars a week,\" Dan said promptly. \"Plus expenses,\" he added.\n \n Kelly nodded. \"I'll fingerprint you and run a fast agency check. If you're clean, I'll put you on, starting tonight. But keep it quiet.\"\n \n \n\n \n Dan looked around at the gray walls, with shelves stacked to the low ceiling with wrapped paintings. Two three-hundred-watt bulbs shed a white glare over the tile floor, a neat white refrigerator, a bunk, an arm-chair, a bookshelf and a small table set with paper plates, plastic utensils and a portable radio—all hastily installed at Kelly's order. Dan opened the refrigerator, looked over the stock of salami, liverwurst, cheese and beer. He opened a loaf of bread, built up a well-filled sandwich, keyed open a can of beer.\n \n It wasn't fancy, but it would do. Phase one of the plan had gone off without a hitch.\n \n Basically, his idea was simple. Art collections had been disappearing from closely guarded galleries and homes all over the world. It was obvious that no one could enter a locked vault, remove a stack of large canvases and leave, unnoticed by watchful guards—and leaving the locks undamaged.\n \n Yet the paintings were gone. Someone had been in those vaults—someone who hadn't entered in the usual way.\n \n Theory failed at that point; that left the experimental method. The Snithian collection was the largest west of the Mississippi. With such a target, the thieves were bound to show up. If Dan sat in the vault—day and night—waiting—he would see for himself how they operated.\n \n He finished his sandwich, went to the shelves and pulled down one of the brown-paper bundles. Loosening the string binding the package, he slid a painting into view. It was a gaily colored view of an open-air cafe, with a group of men and women in gay-ninetyish costumes gathered at a table. He seemed to remember reading something about it in a magazine. It was a cheerful scene; Dan liked it. Still, it hardly seemed worth all the effort....\n \n He went to the wall switch and turned off the lights. The orange glow of the filaments died, leaving only a faint illumination from the night-light over the door. When the thieves arrived, it might give him a momentary advantage if his eyes were adjusted to the dark. He groped his way to the bunk.\n \n So far, so good, he reflected, stretching out. When they showed up, he'd have to handle everything just right. If he scared them off there'd be no second chance. He would have lost his crack at—whatever his discovery might mean to him.\n \n But he was ready. Let them come.\n \n \n\n \n Eight hours, three sandwiches and six beers later, Dan roused suddenly from a light doze and sat up on the cot. Between him and the crowded shelving, a palely luminous framework was materializing in mid-air.\n \n The apparition was an open-work cage—about the size and shape of an out-house minus the sheathing, Dan estimated breathlessly. Two figures were visible within the structure, sitting stiffly in contoured chairs. They glowed, if anything, more brightly than the framework.\n \n A faint sound cut into the stillness—a descending whine. The cage moved jerkily, settling toward the floor. Long blue sparks jumped, crackling, to span the closing gap; with a grate of metal, the cage settled against the floor. The spectral men reached for ghostly switches....\n \n The glow died.\n \n Dan was aware of his heart thumping painfully under his ribs. His mouth was dry. This was the moment he'd been planning for, but now that it was here—\n \n Never mind. He took a deep breath, ran over the speeches he had prepared for the occasion:\n  Greeting, visitors from the Future....\n \n \n Hopelessly corny. What about: Welcome to the Twentieth Century....\n \n \n No good; it lacked spontaneity. The men were rising, their backs to Dan, stepping out of the skeletal frame. In the dim light it now looked like nothing more than a rough frame built of steel pipe, with a cluster of levers in a console before the two seats. And the thieves looked ordinary enough: Two men in gray coveralls, one slender and balding, the other shorter and round-faced. Neither of them noticed Dan, sitting rigid on the cot. The thin man placed a lantern on the table, twiddled a knob. A warm light sprang up. The visitors looked at the stacked shelves.\n \n \"Looks like the old boy's been doing all right,\" the shorter man said.\n\"Fathead's gonna be pleased.\"\n \n \"A very gratifying consignment,\" his companion said. \"However, we'd best hurry, Manny. How much time have we left on this charge?\"\n \n \"Plenty. Fifteen minutes anyway.\"\n \n The thin man opened a package, glanced at a painting.\n \n \"Ah, magnificent. Almost the equal of Picasso in his puce period.\"\n \n Manny shuffled through the other pictures in the stack.\n \n \"Like always,\" he grumbled. \"No nood dames. I like nood dames.\"\n \n \"Look at this, Manny! The textures alone—\"\n \n Manny looked. \"Yeah, nice use of values,\" he conceded. \"But I still prefer nood dames, Fiorello.\"\n \n \"And this!\" Fiorello lifted the next painting. \"Look at that gay play of rich browns!\"\n \n \"I seen richer browns on Thirty-third Street,\" Manny said. \"They was popular with the sparrows.\"\n \n \"Manny, sometimes I think your aspirations—\"\n \n \"Whatta ya talkin? I use a roll-on.\" Manny, turning to place a painting in the cage, stopped dead as he caught sight of Dan. The painting clattered to the floor. Dan stood, cleared his throat. \"Uh....\"\n \n \"Oh-oh,\" Manny said. \"A double-cross.\"\n \n \"I've—ah—been expecting you gentlemen,\" Dan said. \"I—\"\n \n \"I told you we couldn't trust no guy with nine fingers on each hand,\" Manny whispered hoarsely. He moved toward the cage. \"Let's blow, Fiorello.\"\n \n \"Wait a minute,\" Dan said. \"Before you do anything hasty—\"\n \n \"Don't start nothing, Buster,\" Manny said cautiously. \"We're plenty tough guys when aroused.\"\n \n \"I want to talk to you,\" Dan insisted. \"You see, these paintings—\"\n \n \"Paintings? Look, it was all a mistake. Like, we figured this was the gent's room—\"\n \n \"Never mind, Manny,\" Fiorello cut in. \"It appears there's been a leak.\"\n \n Dan shook his head. \"No leak. I simply deduced—\"\n \n \"Look, Fiorello,\" Manny said. \"You chin if you want to; I'm doing a fast fade.\"\n \n \"Don't act hastily, Manny. You know where you'll end.\"\n \n \"Wait a minute!\" Dan shouted. \"I'd like to make a deal with you fellows.\"\n \n \"Ah-hah!\" Kelly's voice blared from somewhere. \"I knew it! Slane, you crook!\"\n \n \n\n \n Dan looked about wildly. The voice seemed to be issuing from a speaker. It appeared Kelly hedged his bets.\n \n \"Mr. Kelly, I can explain everything!\" Dan called. He turned back to Fiorello. \"Listen, I figured out—\"\n \n \"Pretty clever!\" Kelly's voice barked. \"Inside job. But it takes more than the likes of you to out-fox an old-timer like Eddie Kelly.\"\n \n \"Perhaps you were right, Manny,\" Fiorello said. \"Complications are arising. We'd best depart with all deliberate haste.\" He edged toward the cage.\n \n \"What about this ginzo?\" Manny jerked a thumb toward Dan. \"He's on to us.\"\n \n \"Can't be helped.\"\n \n \"Look—I want to go with you!\" Dan shouted.\n \n \"I'll bet you do!\" Kelly's voice roared. \"One more minute and I'll have the door open and collar the lot of you! Came up through a tunnel, did you?\"\n \n \"You can't go, my dear fellow,\" Fiorello said. \"Room for two, no more.\"\n \n Dan whirled to the cot, grabbed up the pistol Kelly had supplied. He aimed it at Manny. \"You stay here, Manny! I'm going with Fiorello in the time machine.\"\n \n \"Are you nuts?\" Manny demanded.\n \n \"I'm flattered, dear boy,\" Fiorello said, \"but—\"\n \n \"Let's get moving. Kelly will have that lock open in a minute.\"\n \n \"You can't leave me here!\" Manny spluttered, watching Dan crowd into the cage beside Fiorello.\n \n \"We'll send for you,\" Dan said. \"Let's go, Fiorello.\"\n \n The balding man snatched suddenly for the gun. Dan wrestled with him. The pistol fell, bounced on the floor of the cage, skidded into the far corner of the vault. Manny charged, reaching for Dan as he twisted aside; Fiorello's elbow caught him in the mouth. Manny staggered back into the arms of Kelly, bursting red-faced into the vault.\n \n \"Manny!\" Fiorello released his grip on Dan, lunged to aid his companion. Kelly passed Manny to one of three cops crowding in on his heels. Dan clung to the framework as Fiorello grappled with Kelly. A cop pushed past them, spotted Dan, moved in briskly for the pinch. Dan grabbed a lever at random and pulled.\n \n Sudden silence fell as the walls of the room glowed blue. A spectral Kelly capered before the cage, fluorescing in the blue-violet. Dan swallowed hard and nudged a second lever. The cage sank like an elevator into the floor, vivid blue washing up its sides.\n \n Hastily he reversed the control. Operating a time machine was tricky business. One little slip, and the Slane molecules would be squeezing in among brick and mortar particles....\n \n But this was no time to be cautious. Things hadn't turned out just the way he'd planned, but after all, this was what he'd wanted—in a way. The time machine was his to command. And if he gave up now and crawled back into the vault, Kelly would gather him in and pin every art theft of the past decade on him.\n \n It couldn't be too hard. He'd take it slowly, figure out the controls....\n \n \n\n \n Dan took a deep breath and tried another lever. The cage rose gently, in eerie silence. It reached the ceiling and kept going. Dan gritted his teeth as an eight-inch band of luminescence passed down the cage. Then he was emerging into a spacious kitchen. A blue-haloed cook waddled to a luminous refrigerator, caught sight of Dan rising slowly from the floor, stumbled back, mouth open. The cage rose, penetrated a second ceiling. Dan looked around at a carpeted hall.\n \n Cautiously he neutralized the control lever. The cage came to rest an inch above the floor. As far as Dan could tell, he hadn't traveled so much as a minute into the past or future.\n \n He looked over the controls. There should be one labeled \"Forward\" and another labeled \"Back\", but all the levers were plain, unadorned black. They looked, Dan decided, like ordinary circuit-breaker type knife-switches. In fact, the whole apparatus had the appearance of something thrown together hastily from common materials. Still, it worked. So far he had only found the controls for maneuvering in the usual three dimensions, but the time switch was bound to be here somewhere....\n \n Dan looked up at a movement at the far end of the hall.\n \n A girl's head and shoulders appeared, coming up a spiral staircase. In another second she would see him, and give the alarm—and Dan needed a few moments of peace and quiet in which to figure out the controls. He moved a lever. The cage drifted smoothly sideways, sliced through the wall with a flurry of vivid blue light. Dan pushed the lever back. He was in a bedroom now, a wide chamber with flouncy curtains, a four-poster under a flowered canopy, a dressing table—\n \n The door opened and the girl stepped into the room. She was young. Not over eighteen, Dan thought—as nearly as he could tell with the blue light playing around her face. She had long hair tied with a ribbon, and long legs, neatly curved. She wore shorts and carried a tennis racquet in her left hand and an apple in her right. Her back to Dan and the cage, she tossed the racquet on a table, took a bite of the apple, and began briskly unbuttoning her shirt.\n \n Dan tried moving a lever. The cage edged toward the girl. Another; he rose gently. The girl tossed the shirt onto a chair and undid the zipper down the side of the shorts. Another lever; the cage shot toward the outer wall as the girl reached behind her back....\n \n Dan blinked at the flash of blue and looked down. He was hovering twenty feet above a clipped lawn.\n \n He looked at the levers. Wasn't it the first one in line that moved the cage ahead? He tried it, shot forward ten feet. Below, a man stepped out on the terrace, lit a cigarette, paused, started to turn his face up—\n \n Dan jabbed at a lever. The cage shot back through the wall. He was in a plain room with a depression in the floor, a wide window with a planter filled with glowing blue plants—\n \n The door opened. Even blue, the girl looked graceful as a deer as she took a last bite of the apple and stepped into the ten-foot-square sunken tub. Dan held his breath. The girl tossed the apple core aside, seemed to suddenly become aware of eyes on her, whirled—\n \n With a sudden lurch that threw Dan against the steel bars, the cage shot through the wall into the open air and hurtled off with an acceleration that kept him pinned, helpless. He groped for the controls, hauled at a lever. There was no change. The cage rushed on, rising higher. In the distance, Dan saw the skyline of a town, approaching with frightful speed. A tall office building reared up fifteen stories high. He was headed dead for it—\n \n He covered his ears, braced himself—\n \n With an abruptness that flung him against the opposite side of the cage, the machine braked, shot through the wall and slammed to a stop. Dan sank to the floor of the cage, breathing hard. There was a loud click! and the glow faded.\n \n With a lunge, Dan scrambled out of the cage. He stood looking around at a simple brown-painted office, dimly lit by sunlight filtered through elaborate venetian blinds. There were posters on the wall, a potted plant by the door, a heap of framed paintings beside it, and at the far side of the room a desk. And behind the desk—Something.\n \n \n\n II\n \n Dan gaped at a head the size of a beachball, mounted on a torso like a hundred-gallon bag of water. Two large brown eyes blinked at him from points eight inches apart. Immense hands with too many fingers unfolded and reached to open a brown paper carton, dip in, then toss three peanuts, deliberately, one by one, into a gaping mouth that opened just above the brown eyes.\n \n \"Who're you?\" a bass voice demanded from somewhere near the floor.\n \n \"I'm ... I'm ... Dan Slane ... your honor.\"\n \n \"What happened to Manny and Fiorello?\"\n \n \"They—I—There was this cop. Kelly—\"\n \n \"Oh-oh.\" The brown eyes blinked deliberately. The many-fingered hands closed the peanut carton and tucked it into a drawer.\n \n \"Well, it was a sweet racket while it lasted,\" the basso voice said. \"A pity to terminate so happy an enterprise. Still....\" A noise like an amplified Bronx cheer issued from the wide mouth.\n \n \"How ... what...?\"\n \n \"The carrier returns here automatically when the charge drops below a critical value,\" the voice said. \"A necessary measure to discourage big ideas on the part of wisenheimers in my employ. May I ask how you happen to be aboard the carrier, by the way?\"\n \n \"I just wanted—I mean, after I figured out—that is, the police ... I went for help,\" Dan finished lamely.\n \n \"Help? Out of the picture, unfortunately. One must maintain one's anonymity, you'll appreciate. My operation here is under wraps at present. Ah, I don't suppose you brought any paintings?\"\n \n Dan shook his head. He was staring at the posters. His eyes, accustoming themselves to the gloom of the office, could now make out the vividly drawn outline of a creature resembling an alligator-headed giraffe rearing up above scarlet foliage. The next poster showed a face similar to the beachball behind the desk, with red circles painted around the eyes. The next was a view of a yellow volcano spouting fire into a black sky.\n \n \"Too bad.\" The words seemed to come from under the desk. Dan squinted, caught a glimpse of coiled purplish tentacles. He gulped and looked up to catch a brown eye upon him. Only one. The other seemed to be busily at work studying the ceiling.\n \n \"I hope,\" the voice said, \"that you ain't harboring no reactionary racial prejudices.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Gosh, no,\" Dan reassured the eye. \"I'm crazy about—uh—\"\n \n \"Vorplischers,\" the voice said. \"From Vorplisch, or Vega, as you call it.\" The Bronx cheer sounded again. \"How I long to glimpse once more my native fens! Wherever one wanders, there's no pad like home.\"\n \n \"That reminds me,\" Dan said. \"I have to be running along now.\" He sidled toward the door.\n \n \"Stick around, Dan,\" the voice rumbled. \"How about a drink? I can offer you Chateau Neuf du Pape, '59, Romance Conte, '32, goat's milk, Pepsi—\"\n \n \"No, thanks.\"\n \n \"If you don't mind, I believe I'll have a Big Orange.\" The Vorplischer swiveled to a small refrigerator, removed an immense bottle fitted with a nipple and turned back to Dan. \"Now, I got a proposition which may be of some interest to you. The loss of Manny and Fiorello is a serious blow, but we may yet recoup the situation. You made the scene at a most opportune time. What I got in mind is, with those two clowns out of the picture, a vacancy exists on my staff, which you might well fill. How does that grab you?\"\n \n \"You mean you want me to take over operating the time machine?\"\n \n \"Time machine?\" The brown eyes blinked alternately. \"I fear some confusion exists. I don't quite dig the significance of the term.\"\n \n \"That thing,\" Dan jabbed a thumb toward the cage. \"The machine I came here in. You want me—\"\n \n \"Time machine,\" the voice repeated. \"Some sort of chronometer, perhaps?\"\n \n \"Huh?\"\n \n \"I pride myself on my command of the local idiom, yet I confess the implied concept snows me.\" The nine-fingered hands folded on the desk. The beachball head leaned forward interestedly. \"Clue me, Dan. What's a time machine?\"\n \n \"Well, it's what you use to travel through time.\"\n \n The brown eyes blinked in agitated alternation. \"Apparently I've loused up my investigation of the local cultural background. I had no idea you were capable of that sort of thing.\" The immense head leaned back, the wide mouth opening and closing rapidly. \"And to think I've been spinning my wheels collecting primitive 2-D art!\"\n \n \"But—don't you have a time machine? I mean, isn't that one?\"\n \n \"That? That's merely a carrier. Now tell me more about your time machines. A fascinating concept! My superiors will be delighted at this development—and astonished as well. They regard this planet as Endsville.\"\n \n \n\n \n \"Your superiors?\" Dan eyed the window; much too far to jump. Maybe he could reach the machine and try a getaway—\n \n \"I hope you're not thinking of leaving suddenly,\" the beachball said, following Dan's glance. One of the eighteen fingers touched a six-inch yellow cylinder lying on the desk. \"Until the carrier is fueled, I'm afraid it's quite useless. But, to put you in the picture, I'd best introduce myself and explain my mission here. I'm Blote, Trader Fourth Class, in the employ of the Vegan Confederation. My job is to develop new sources of novelty items for the impulse-emporiums of the entire Secondary Quadrant.\"\n \n \"But the way Manny and Fiorello came sailing in through the wall! That has to be a time machine they were riding in. Nothing else could just materialize out of thin air like that.\"\n \n \"You seem to have a time-machine fixation, Dan,\" Blote said. \"You shouldn't assume, just because you people have developed time travel, that everyone has. Now—\" Blote's voice sank to a bass whisper—\"I'll make a deal with you, Dan. You'll secure a small time machine in good condition for me. And in return—\"\n \n \" I'm supposed to supply you with a time machine?\"\n \n Blote waggled a stubby forefinger at Dan. \"I dislike pointing it out, Dan, but you are in a rather awkward position at the moment. Illegal entry, illegal possession of property, trespass—then doubtless some embarrassment exists back at the Snithian residence. I daresay Mr. Kelly would have a warm welcome for you. And, of course, I myself would deal rather harshly with any attempt on your part to take a powder.\" The Vegan flexed all eighteen fingers, drummed his tentacles under the desk, and rolled one eye, bugging the other at Dan.\n \n \"Whereas, on the other hand,\" Blote's bass voice went on, \"you and me got the basis of a sweet deal. You supply the machine, and I fix you up with an abundance of the local medium of exchange. Equitable enough, I should say. What about it, Dan?\"\n \n \"Ah, let me see,\" Dan temporized. \"Time machine. Time machine—\"\n \n \"Don't attempt to weasel on me, Dan,\" Blote rumbled ominously.\n \n \"I'd better look in the phone book,\" Dan suggested.\n \n Silently, Blote produced a dog-eared directory. Dan opened it.\n \n \"Time, time. Let's see....\" He brightened. \"Time, Incorporated; local branch office. Two twenty-one Maple Street.\"\n \n \"A sales center?\" Blote inquired. \"Or a manufacturing complex?\"\n \n \"Both,\" Dan said. \"I'll just nip over and—\"\n \n \"That won't be necessary, Dan,\" Blote said. \"I'll accompany you.\" He took the directory, studied it.\n \n \"Remarkable! A common commodity, openly on sale, and I failed to notice it. Still, a ripe nut can fall from a small tree as well as from a large.\" He went to his desk, rummaged, came up with a handful of fuel cells. \"Now, off to gather in the time machine.\" He took his place in the carrier, patted the seat beside him with a wide hand. \"Come, Dan. Get a wiggle on.\"\n \n \n\n \n Hesitantly, Dan moved to the carrier. The bluff was all right up to a point—but the point had just about been reached. He took his seat. Blote moved a lever. The familiar blue glow sprang up. \"Kindly direct me, Dan,\" Blote demanded. \"Two twenty-one Maple Street, I believe you said.\"\n \n \"I don't know the town very well,\" Dan said, \"but Maple's over that way.\"\n \n Blote worked levers. The carrier shot out into a ghostly afternoon sky. Faint outlines of buildings, like faded negatives, spread below. Dan looked around, spotted lettering on a square five-story structure.\n \n \"Over there,\" he said. Blote directed the machine as it swooped smoothly toward the flat roof Dan indicated.\n \n \"Better let me take over now,\" Dan suggested. \"I want to be sure to get us to the right place.\"\n \n \"Very well, Dan.\"\n \n Dan dropped the carrier through the roof, passed down through a dimly seen office. Blote twiddled a small knob. The scene around the cage grew even fainter. \"Best we remain unnoticed,\" he explained.\n \n The cage descended steadily. Dan peered out, searching for identifying landmarks. He leveled off at the second floor, cruised along a barely visible corridor. Blote's eyes rolled, studying the small chambers along both sides of the passage at once.\n \n \"Ah, this must be the assembly area,\" he exclaimed. \"I see the machines employ a bar-type construction, not unlike our carriers.\"\n \n \"That's right,\" Dan said, staring through the haziness. \"This is where they do time....\" He tugged at a lever suddenly; the machine veered left, flickered through a barred door, came to a halt. Two nebulous figures loomed beside the cage. Dan cut the switch. If he'd guessed wrong—\n \n The scene fluoresced, sparks crackling, then popped into sharp focus. Blote scrambled out, brown eyes swivelling to take in the concrete walls, the barred door and—\n \n \"You!\" a hoarse voice bellowed.\n \n \"Grab him!\" someone yelled.\n \n Blote recoiled, threshing his ambulatory members in a fruitless attempt to regain the carrier as Manny and Fiorello closed in. Dan hauled at a lever. He caught a last glimpse of three struggling, blue-lit figures as the carrier shot away through the cell wall.\n \n \n\n III\n \n Dan slumped back against the seat with a sigh. Now that he was in the clear, he would have to decide on his next move—fast. There was no telling what other resources Blote might have. He would have to hide the carrier, then—\n \n A low growling was coming from somewhere, rising in pitch and volume. Dan sat up, alarmed. This was no time for a malfunction.\n \n The sound rose higher, into a penetrating wail. There was no sign of mechanical trouble. The carrier glided on, swooping now over a nebulous landscape of trees and houses. Dan covered his ears against the deafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once. If the carrier stopped it would be a long fall from here. Dan worked the controls, dropping toward the distant earth.\n \n The noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, brought the carrier in to the corner of a wide park. He dropped the last few inches and cut the switch.\n \n As the glow died, the siren faded into silence.\n \n Dan stepped from the carrier and looked around. Whatever the noise was, it hadn't attracted any attention from the scattered pedestrians in the park. Perhaps it was some sort of burglar alarm. But if so, why hadn't it gone into action earlier? Dan took a deep breath. Sound or no sound, he would have to get back into the carrier and transfer it to a secluded spot where he could study it at leisure. He stepped back in, reached for the controls—\n \n There was a sudden chill in the air. The bright surface of the dials before him frosted over. There was a loud pop! like a flashbulb exploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectangle which hung suspended near the carrier. Its surface rippled, faded to blankness. In a swirl of frosty air, a tall figure dressed in a tight-fitting white uniform stepped through.\n \n Dan gaped at the small rounded head, the dark-skinned long-nosed face, the long, muscular arms, the hands, their backs tufted with curly red-brown hair, the strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. A neat pillbox cap with a short visor was strapped low over the deep-set yellowish eyes, which turned in his direction. The wide mouth opened in a smile which showed square yellowish teeth.\n \n \" Alors, monsieur ,\" the new-comer said, bending his knees and back in a quick bow. \" Vous ete une indigine, n'est ce pas? \"\n \n \"No compree,\" Dan choked out \"Uh ... juh no parlay Fransay....\"\n \n \"My error. This is the Anglic colonial sector, isn't it? Stupid of me. Permit me to introduce myself. I'm Dzhackoon, Field Agent of Class five, Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n \n \"That siren,\" Dan said. \"Was that you?\"\n \n Dzhackoon nodded. \"For a moment, it appeared you were disinclined to stop. I'm glad you decided to be reasonable.\"\n \n \"What outfit did you say you were with?\" Dan asked.\n \n \"The Inter-dimensional Monitor Service.\"\n \n \"Inter-what?\"\n \n \"Dimensional. The word is imprecise, of course, but it's the best our language coder can do, using the Anglic vocabulary.\"\n \n \"What do you want with me?\"", "source": "squality", "split": "dev", "passage_id": "52855", "license": "This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever.
