This Terran League University was far too expensive for any Snaddrath to afford, not only due to tuition costs. The travel expenses alone were outrageous.

Since Bbulas was schooled there, he has more Terran tendencies than his brethren, such as his ability to not show emotions or keep from whirling when upset. \nAfter attending university, he was selected to work as the Planetary Dilettante.

Bbulas considers himself superior due to his education and thinks he is talented in multiple ways, including speechwriting and even building shelters. He anticipated the Terrans’ interests and makes sure the females are scantily clad and rewrites the words to their popular songs to make them less suggestive in case the Terrans have learned any Snadd.

Although he claims that in the program he created, each individual’s position was selected randomly, he openly acknowledges that he was the only person who could possibly pose as the high priest.

He believes someone with more charm and adaptiveness should be in charge of society’s survival, and he isn’t impressed with Bbula’s grand scheme to win over the Terran anthropologists. When he hears Lahrgran making her speech as High Priestess, he instantly recognizes that Bbulas was the speechwriter and complains that it’s far too long and involved.

He has a particular role in the society as the Planetary Dilettante, which means he is the one person in his generation who was afforded an off-world education where he could learn from the Terran style system, which focuses more on emotional regulation than the native training. He was educated on Gambrell, a nearby planet which has a Terran League University. The government can only afford to send one person per generation to receive this kind of schooling so it is considered a high honor. The Dilettante is the one on standby for when there are emergencies, and the President decided that the arrival of the Earthmen was such an emergency. In order to prepare for the arrival of the Terrans, he set up everything necessary to fool the Terrans into thinking the Snaddrath were more primitive than they actually were. He was the one who restructured society so that the metal workers were the lower class, as they were the most populous group of people, and assigned Skkiru the role of a beggar which forced him to break off his engagement with Larhgan as she was assigned the high priestess role. This is especially angering to Skkiru because Bbulas assigned himself the high priest role. Skkiru is frustrated with Bbulas for making him a beggar and also disappointed because he thinks he could have been more creative in his set-up of a new society, especially being as intelligent as he was. He used blueprints from a Terrestrial magazine to build some of the above-ground features, instead of designing his own, for instance. At the beginning of the story, he is bickering with Skkiru about the fact that Skkiru is now a beggar, and all of the issues that come for Skkiru with that. He eventually led Skkiru and Larhgan to the surface of the planet when they received notice that the Earthmen had arrived, and focused on greeting these visitors.

When the Boyars settled the planet sixty years ago, it was habitable but unable to support much agriculture. They have spent sixty years terraforming Flamme, clearing jungles, descumming seas, irrigating deserts, and planting forests. Fifty years ago, the Boyars learned how to breed a special strain of bacteria that breaks down the granite that covered much of the surface. The granite breaks down to soil, and the Boyars add broad-spectrum fertilizer to make the land arable. The Boyars now have many fields of crops and are continuing to develop new sections for more. Their many years of intensive work in creating farming land and growing crops gives them a vested interest in their settlement.\nThe Aga Kagans are involved in empire-building. They have sent what appear to be goat herders and fishermen to Flamme to begin taking over the land. The goat herders are all male and have rocket launchers. They present a false appearance as homesteaders who lack access to modern technology; in reality, their tents are high-polymer plastic, and their robes are bullet-proof. On their home planet, they have helis and ground cars. The homesteaders set up camp in the middle of farm fields, allow their goats to graze on the crops, and cook their sheep’s brains over dung fires. The fishermen are actually the Aga Kagan navy who come equipped with 40 mm infinite repeaters. The CDT knows that the Aga Kagans have been using this same method of invasion for the past five years in six other worlds. The Aga Kagans hide their modern technology in the places they are invading to dupe the people they are intruding on and to please the older conservatives in their government. \nThe Aga Kagans’ approach to empire-building is based on their knowledge of Earth history. While their society has modern technology, their false appearance of third world trappings can be used to justify their invasions into “more advanced” societies. Stanley admits the Aga Kagans move into an area after others have done the hard work of building the community and civilization so that the Aga Kagans can enjoy the fruits of the others’ labors. By appearing to be a third world civilization, the Aga Kagans can defend their actions and gain empathy with a claim of “legitimate aspirations, for self-determination of formerly exploited peoples.” Stanley also acknowledges his familiarity with empire-builders on Earth and claims he won’t make their mistake of going “too far, too fast.” He couches their approach as “an ancient and honorable custom” and references Mein Kampf, the Communist Manifesto, and Leung’s the Porcelain Wall.

He speaks negatively about the Aga Kagan and their elders which he pays lip service to, but ultimately executes his own strategies that may or may not be in line with the historical actions of their people. Stanley uses the history of the Aga Kagan as formerly exploited people to place the Corps into a complicated diplomatic situation to get his way that he relishes in and laughs about during the diplomatic visit from Retief and Georges.", "The leader of the Aga Kagans uses history as a way to justify his actions and prove to himself and others that he will face little to no resistance in the process. He references colonial imperialism, colonization, and some of the most hated figures in history as his predecessors. By relying on the Corps silence, he truly believes that he will be able to conquer Flamme, destroy the Boyars, and do all this without any humanitarian uprising. \nBy taking it slow and biding their times, the Aga Kagans will acquire their empire slowly but surely. Based on previous knowledge, the Aga truly believes that the Corps will simply accept their invasion, so long as they don’t move too quickly. He cites Hitler, Leung, and Stalin as references: these people moved too far too fast. \nHistory also sets up the present conflict. Sixty years earlier, the Corps encouraged and asked the Boyars to terraform Flamme and transform it into something beautiful. The Boyars did so, believing the Corps wwere on their side. Now, half a century later with the Aga Kagans encroaching on their territory, the Boyars are waiting for their previously promised Corps support and coming up empty.

The planet itself has a lot of history, which is part of the current conflict. The Aga Kagans had not wanted to help terraform the planet, but now that the hard work was done over many decades, they wanted to move in. History also plays a role in communication more generally. The Aga Kagans communicate in proverbs, which act as idioms referencing specific historical events. The Aga Kagans are also familiar with the history of other cultures, and aim to control the narrative of the history of various planets, deciding who is considered a warmonger versus labeling their own takeovers in a positive light. The Aga Kaga knows a lot about the history of Earth as well, and cites a number of historical events to Reteif during their impassioned discussion, along with names of famous historical manifestos.

In contrast, the eggs themselves are like magnificent works of art, with crystal clear shells and yolks that seem to emit electricity. These flashes of light start as the eggs are pulled out of the mud by the humans, and some suspect it is a way for the egg to signal to its mother that it is being handled by someone else.

At the lab, Swarts tells Maitland to lay on the surgical cot, where cables run from the ceiling to the focus above the cot in the center of the room. When Maitland refuses to corporate, Swarts uses his fist to hit Maitland’s solar plexus and put him onto the cot, where he is forced to remain still. The tiny electrodes are placed at his temples and other parts of his body, minute microphone placed on the skin over his heart, and a sphygmomanometer on his arm. Those gadgets are used to record his involuntary responses. When Maitland realizes that he is in the future, he refuses to corporate. Then, Swarts places two cylindrical tubes over Maitland’s head, there are lenses at the end of the tubes. The tiny clamps on Maitland’s eyelashes prevent his eyelids from closing for a long time. Earphones are placed in his ears. A video is played through the lenses.", "Swarts uses many different gadgets throughout the story. Along the wall of Swarts' laboratory are several electronic cabinets holding cathode ray tube screens. He uses a lie detector on Maitland made up of a multitude of tiny electrodes and a sphygmomanometer sleeve. He then uses an apparatus which he lowers over Maitland's head, with two cylindrical tubes with lenses at the end, and clamps to keep his eyelids open. It has a screen inside that projects videos.", "The first machine used by Swarts on Maitland when conducting the psychological tests is similar to a lie detector. The machine is meant to record Maitland’s reactions to the different tests that he is given. It operates by attaching electrodes to Maitland’s temples and other parts of his body and then putting a tiny microphone on his skin near his heart. In addition, a sphygmomanometer sleeve is wrapped around one of his arms. The different instruments on this machine are used to record the changes in Maitland’s skin potential, blood pressure, and heartbeat. Thus, it measures his natural reaction to the stimuli he will be exposed to during the tests. \n\nThe next time he is tested, it is a new machine that has two cylindrical tubes similar to a binocular microscope that is placed over his head. Tiny clamps are attached to his eyelashes to keep his eyes from shutting. Earphones are also used to further the immersive experience of the new test.

But he still reaches the elevator in time to reach Linda’s place thirteen stories below his level on time, except the elevator doesn’t come. The longer he waits for the elevator car, the more anxious Edmund grows, knowing that Linda will be so upset if he is late he won’t get to propose.\n\tEdmund loves Linda and would like to have a permanent marriage, but he realizes that Linda enjoys her freedom and independence too much to agree to a permanent marriage.

Edmund is convinced that she won’t speak to him again after being late for the proposal and certainly will not accept his proposal. In a last-ditch effort to reach Linda, Edmund decides he can take 208 stairs to reach her, even though he hasn’t taken the stairs since he was 12 years old. This decision, of course, puts him in the path to run into the spy.\n\tFinally, Linda’s job helps Edmund believe he can overtake the spy if he can catch him off guard.

Her adherence comes from her job as an ore-sled dispatcher; when an ore-sled doesn’t return, it means the sled has been captured or destroyed.

Once, she and Edmund had first started dating, Edmund arrived at her apartment five minutes late to find Linda in complete hysterics; she thought Edmund had been killed. When Edmund explained he had simply been late, she didn't speak to him for four days. This explains Edmund's panic when the elevator fails to arrive the morning he plans to propose to Linda at 10:00 precisely. Linda anticipates the proposal, so she switches her phone to \"privacy disconnection\" mode in order to prevent them from being disturbed when Edmunds pops the question.

She is in a relationship with Edmund, and expects that he will propose marriage to her when he tells her he has something important to talk about. \nShe is significant to the story because her punctuality places great stress on Edmund when he knows he will be late. This causes him to frantically panic when the elevator is not working, and resort to using the stairwell to attempt to meet with her before their relationship deteriorates beyond repair. Linda’s reaction to tardiness is very strict, evidenced when Edmund describes to the Transit Staff when he files a complaint about the elevator that they have ruined his life and that Linda will no longer speak to him or even consider marrying him. Because Linda means so much to Edmund, he continues to try to get to her even when he knows he is over 15 minutes late.

The people in them do not have to go outside where they fear radiation from atomic bombs used in the wars still exists. The Projects provide restaurants, shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners, schools, churches, factories, etc. Food is grown hydroponically. The Projects are protected by force screens that deflect the radiation and all have their own armies that are supposed to protect them from spies from other Projects.\n\tThe Projects have advanced technology.

There is a Non-P marriage option in this case: Non-Permanent and No Progeny. In Non-P marriages, people contract to marry for a short term, such as one or two years. People are also scared of strangers; hence, the man in the elevator is deemed a spy before anyone even speaks with him.", "The Spy in the Elevator by Donald E. Westlake takes place in the century after the year 2000. After the third of the Ungentelamnly Wars, AKA World War III, Earth was scorched and full of radiation. The remaining population moved into self-sustaining Projects that feature 200+ floors of residential housing, churches, gyms, cafés, and even a hydroponic farm in the basement. Humans were locked away due to the deadly levels of radiation outside due to the tactical atomic bombings. Each Project defends itself with an Army and various equipment as no one is sure whether or not another Project will attack. \nThe Project that Edmund Rice and Linda live in has 200 floors and features all the normal amenities. The elevator, however, is the main source of travel, and no one uses the stairs anymore. Edmund’s room is modest, and he receives a small supply of food daily to prevent any waste.", "The Projects had been developed as a result of population booms and the Treaty of Oslo following Word War III, cheekily called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War by Edmunds Intermediate Project History teacher Dr. Kilbillie. Prior to 1900, everyone lived in small, one-to-five-story homes. By the year 2000, everyone lived in the giant high-rises called Projects, also known as apartments or co-ops. The Projects were several hundred stories tall and were essential compact nations that included restaurants, shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners, etc. Eventually, the Projects became self-sustaining and added schools, churches, factories, robot ore-sleds, etc. The Treaty of Oslo disallowed deployment of strategic atomic weapons and only permitted the use of tactical weapons, which resulted in the world's current state of omnipresent radiation. In the years since, no one has left the buildings to go Outside, except the ore-sleds that seek out raw materials and the spies that invade the protective force-screens to seek out information about potential attacks from other Projects. The residents have developed a level of comfort with life in the Projects, even though they are only allotted a certain amount of food each day and can never leave. Later, the \"spy\" posits that the residents are being fed lies by the Commission, which runs the Projects and profits from their operation.", "After the year 2100, humans live in Projects, which are self-sufficient vertical buildings that essentially govern themselves. Raw materials come in and out on ore-sleds and the humans in the Projects have no contact with the outside world. Vertical living became the norm because population explosion meant there was no more horizontal space for people to expand into. Then, with the onset of nuclear warfare in the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, the only safety for the public was to stay inside their residence in the Projects because of the Treaty of Oslo, which stipulates that in this era of atomic weapons, civilians are not to be targeted.\nThere has been so much atomic bombing that the radiation levels outside are said to be too unsafe for humans to endure. The Projects are suspicious of each other planning attacks, and there is high alert for spies from nearby projects infiltrating the building. The people within the Projects live in fear of atomic attacks, though they do not question the accuracy of what they have been told. There hasn’t been an attack in decades, and this threat is largely now just a fear in the minds of the people. They go on with their daily lives, not checking to see if the radiation from the outside remains too high to go outdoors, but just believing what they are told. \nIn one Project, on the 153rd floor lives Edmund Rice in a nicely appointed apartment building, with a video calling service he can use to dial other residents and the building Transit Staff, and he receives allotted rations of food just as all of the other residents do. The love of his life that he wishes to propose Non-P marriage to, Linda, lives on the 144th floor of the same building. There is a local elevator that serves the higher floors that Edmund frequently uses, though it is out of order due to a spy jamming its controls and hiding inside it. There is a stairwell next to the elevator, and on a landing between the 150th and 149th floor there is a small door to the elevator shaft. \nThe spy - an atomic engineer from a neighboring Project - has discovered that the radiation is actually low outside and it is now safe for humans to venture out.

The spy in the elevator isn’t really a spy, but the Army claims he is. It is in the interest of the Army and the Commissions of the Projects for people to believe that the radiation level outside the Projects is too high for people to survive because keeping people fearful keeps them in the Projects and needful of the Army and Commission. The people in the Projects are taught to be fearful of other Projects who might come and try to learn their secrets, military, technology, or otherwise. The Army is trying to capture the spy who has holed himself up in the elevator and is planning to starve him out if necessary. The spy uses logic to try to convince Edmund that he isn’t really a spy, that the Projects don’t really need to worry about spies, and that the Projects aren’t really needed at all.\n\tThe spy is actually an atomic engineer from a Project about 80 miles north of Edmund’s. He suspected that the radiation levels after the atomic war have dropped low enough to be safe for people to go outside the Projects. When he asks his Commission to be allowed to study this, he is refused. The Commission knows that if people can leave the Projects, there would be no need for the Commission. To secretly test his theory, the spy left his Project and walked all the way to Edmund’s project without a radiation shield. He is fine, and he is trying to convince the people in the Projects that it is safe to go outside; he compares the Projects to caves and the people to cavemen. He claims that the Projects are stunting society’s progress by keeping everyone “locked down.”", "The first conflict is caused by the spy in the elevator, as he prevents Edmund from visiting and therefore proposing to Linda on time. This causes a chain of events that leads to their eventual meeting and Edmund’s partial captivity.

He claims the radiation levels are back to a healthy level and that they have been for years. He believes that the Commission is hiding the truth from people, because, if they knew, the Projects would go out of business, as people are not allowed to leave them for their own health and safety.", "When Edmund realizes the unmoving elevator is going to make him late for his proposal to Linda, he calls the Transit Staff. The staff person reveals to Edmund that a spy has barricaded himself in the elevator and with the help of manual controls is using it as a projectile against anyone who tries to get near him. Edmund had heard of spies going between Projects to try to learn information about any planned attacks, but he is surprised and scared to discover that a spy has managed to penetrate his Project's force-screen. He wonders what this will mean for the overall safety of the Project, but he doesn't dwell on this too long because he still needs to get to Linda. He makes his way down the stairs and encounters a small door, which turns out to be an emergency exit from the elevator shaft. The spy opens the shaft and orders Edmund to lead him back to his apartment at gunpoint. In the apartment, the spy demands coffee, and the two men talk. Edmund claims to be an ore-sled dispatcher, and the spy inquires if the dispatchers check radiation levels when the sleds return from a supply run. Edmund scoffs at this idea, claiming that there would be no point in doing so since the radiation is purged prior to entering the force-screen. The spy reveals himself to be an atomic engineer and tells Edmund that the Project defenses, as well as the claims of toxic radiation levels Outside, are nothing more than a smokescreen, a way to keep the residents of the Projects content to live inside and never venture out. He posits the Commission is responsible for this deception because they want to continue profiting from the operation of the Projects.", "The spy is discovered on the 147th floor of Edmund’s building, and runs into the elevator before the Army can catch him. The spy plugs the manual controls of the elevator so that he can’t be caught, and runs the elevator up and down the shaft if anyone tries to enter the car through the shaft. After he bursts out of the elevator shaft door into the stairwell and forces Edmund to take him back to his apartment to hide, we learn the real story of the spy. He is actually an atomic engineer from another Project where he was in charge of their reactor. He thought the radiation from the war decades ago would likely be so low now that it would be safe for humans to leave the Projects and go outside. However, the Commission would not let him test the theory, so he risked his life to travel to a nearby Project to find out for himself. Because he survived the crossing outside, it is now safe for humans to resume activities outside. This is very significant, because Edmund’s conditioning has him believe that there is no reason to question why they can’t go outside and that there is not going to be a life outside the Project. The spy gives Edmund a reason to believe that what he has been told by the Commission is untrue. Also, the ability of the spy to penetrate so deeply into the project undetected is a significant concern to Edmund, who considers the reliability of the safeguards to keep the people safe from outside enemies."], "dataset": "squality", "split": "dev"}

They argue and try to pull rank on one another, both from intellect and experience. Nagurski explains why cohesion is so important, using his dog as a metaphor, you must win the respect and love of your crew so THEY choose YOU. The crew decide to work as a cohesive unit, working together to save Quade. It is the first time that the Captain can be seen actually working with the team, and not just giving them orders.

This race is known for their extremely efficient technological development, which is attributed at least in part to their government structure. To humans, the air on the planet is a little bit smelly, and they don't expect the Tr'en to have large cultural institutions and interesting works of art because they are led by logic and mathematics alone--they even communicate very literally, talking their way through logic puzzles. There are two rooms that house most of the story: the lone jail cell that Korvin is kept in for six days in total, and the Room of the Ruler where the questioning happens. The jail cell was built very quickly once Korvin was captured, and there are no other prisoners in the jail, so it is a lonely and quiet place for Korvin to sit in, with nothing to occupy him but his own thoughts. There is one bed for him to lie on but nothing else of interest. His only interaction with others is the nightly lessons in the Tr'en language that are done under drug hypnosis. He is escorted out of this solitary confinement to meet The Ruler, whose chambers are a large room with brown and tan everywhere. The walls were dark brown, many of the furnishings were light brown, and the drapes on the windows were tan. Although the brown contrasted nicely with the green skin of the Tr'en, Korvin still found there to be far too much brown in the room. There was a great big chair in the middle for The Ruler to sit in, surrounded by benches for others to kneel at. Eventually, a lie detector chair is brought into the room as well.

The Tr'en are efficient, so all the structures built on the planet are built without flaw. There also isn't anything very exciting to do recreationally on the planet.

It is also suspected they will soon be capable of traveling faster than light, which will earn them an invitation to join the Comity of Planets and which they are sure to reject. The Tr’en have a justice system in place; they have jail cells and the advanced technology that enabled them to build a truth detector device.

Jonathan crash-lands in a vast prairie, which stretches a mile past the crash site to a range of jagged foothills leading up to a chain of mountains. Within this chain, Jonathan sees a puff of smoke issuing from the top of a cone-shaped peak indicating the presence of a volcano. The asteroid is home to centaurs, which appear to be hostile towards humans. When Ann and Jonathan run away from the centaurs, they escape to a small ravine leading into the hills. As they make their way through the ravine, it deepens into a canyon then further into a gorge with walls towering on either side of them. On the floor of the canyon grow yellow, fern-like plants. After the women capture Jonathan, they march him back to camp by way of a narrow ledge climbing the canyon wall which comes to rest at a high ridge overlooking the prairie. Because the asteroid has less gravity than Earth, the women are thirty times as stronger than normal. Their encampment is at the head of a deep valley beyond the canyon's ridge where a tree-flanked stream flows next to their crashed space liner. Inside the space liner is a massive dining area with a long meturilium table at its center sitting atop a green fiberon carpet. It reminds Jonathan of the \"fabulous barbarian past.\"", "In the year 3372, humans have colonized other planets in the solar system, and there is interplanetary transport to support the colonists. Asteroids can be dangerous in the shipping lanes, as the main character, Jonathan Fawkes, finds out when he crashes into one on his way to deliver seeds and other supplies to Jupiter.\nThe asteroid contains prairies, jagged foothills, a chain of mountains, a fuming volcano and deep valley gorges and streams. Dangerous Centaurs that are half man and half horse roam the prairie in herds. There is a ravine nearby to Jonathan’s crash site that opens into a wide gorge with high walls that tower on both sides. Yellow fern-like plants grow within the canyon. The 27 stranded women camp about four miles away from where Jonathan crash lands. They camp in their wrecked ship which has a stream close by to it. There is small game to eat like the furry creature that Ann spears and ties off to her belt. They still use the dining hall on the ship for their meals, and go out daily to hunt, fish, and forage for fruits and berries. \nThe asteroid will cross the interplanetary shipping lane every three years in its orbit, meaning that every three years there is a chance they may come into contact with transport ships again.

They do find a large hatch in the bottom of the building they are in, where Martin and Rodney jump into a deep pile of dust that they essentially wade through in order to make their way towards an exit. However, the pipe that they find to escape through is shut by a metal grate. Wass had never jumped through the hatch, and while standing at the switchboard, flipped four switches that raised the grate for them. Wass died while trying to open the escape route for his crewmates, but if it were not for him they would not have made it out alive."], "dataset": "squality", "split": "dev"}

The levers themselves do not have any controls written by them, and they are all plain, unadorned black. They look like ordinary circuit-breaker type knife-switches, and even the entire carrier looks hastily thrown together. He reaches an area with a hallway and goes into a bedroom shortly after. It is a wide chamber with flouncy curtains, a four-poster bed with a flowered canopy, and a dressing table. The area he is in has a terrace. Then, he steers the machine to a plain room with a depression in the floor, a wide window, and a planter filled with glowing blue plants. In the room, there is also a ten-foot-square sunken tub.
